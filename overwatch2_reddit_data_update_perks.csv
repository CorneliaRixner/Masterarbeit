Is 6v6 open queue more competitive than 5v5?,Overwatch,0,1klmfhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1klmfhx/is_6v6_open_queue_more_competitive_than_5v5/,24,2025-05-13 15:49:55,"Hi gamers!

In Overwatch 2 recent past open queue was never considered a highly competitive game mode. Even though there was a dedicated player base playing competitive open queue 5v5 was still the “real Overwatch”. 

Now that we have 6v6 open queue with limits, rules and bans I’m proposing a discussion about the status of open queue in relation to its competitiveness.

Opinions on widowmaker?,Overwatch,0,1klhfrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1klhfrd/opinions_on_widowmaker/,12,2025-05-13 11:15:53,"inb4 git gut

Hey guys, i've played overwatch since release of ow1, always been a huge widowmaker fan, shes one of my main characters that i play, and i do think i am pretty decent at playing her. I've also been playing ow2 since release, but i had a longer break lately and came back to check out stadium, and got into the game again, but when i play widow in normal, or even ranked matches i always feel like she lacks something? Like she isnt as strong as she used to be? Am i tripping or was she nerfed heavily? Also her perks don't feel as good compared to other characters of similar playstyle. I almost feel stupid picking widow, when i feel like ashe, cassidy, freja, or at this point any other character has a much bigger impact on the game. It might just be me, maybe i'm underperforming after a longer break but i just feel like shes a bit ""off-meta"" i guess. Let me know your thoughts :) "
OCE server issues recently,Overwatch,2,1klg05d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1klg05d/oce_server_issues_recently/,4,2025-05-13 09:32:10,"I’m sorry if this isn’t the forum to post this, but I wasn’t able to find a fix to this problem online anywhere else.

I want to preface this by saying I think the overwatch team have been doing a great job recently with stadium and making the game feel great to play again.

Now for the issue, I play on OCE servers and average about 50ping and I would occasionally (1/10 games) be put into a lobby or server where I average 120ping, which wouldn’t be too large an issue as it happened so rarely. Now however, this server routing has been putting me in these 120ping servers 2/3 games and into servers where I sit at 400ping. For a competitive game, it makes it really difficult for me to play well, enjoy the game and help my teammates.

Does anyone know how to fix this or why this happens? 

Once again sorry for writing a negative post and if this isn’t the place to type it."

My Issues with Ow2 Stadium,Overwatch,0,1kl490y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kl490y/my_issues_with_ow2_stadium/,8,2025-05-12 23:15:08,"This Script is being written on 5/9/2025. This will eventually Be outdated…



	So I have been playing a LOT of overwatch stadium, Its fun for the most part… The Most Part, Alright I’ll cut the short act. Overwatch stadium is far from perfect, like eons from perfect, this is Every single issue I have with stadium.



1. Mercy. Jesus Christ this creature in this game is the most unfair character as unfair characters get. I would rather fight soldier before tactical visor buffs if it meant that mercy either got removed from the roster or just nerfed heavily. One of her upgrades makes her staff able to heal from an extra 33% farther distance. Do you understand what all of this means? If you have a slight understanding of good mercy mobility. YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY UNKILLABLE. Before all you redditors go in the comments and go “eguh, bro never played before.” I have at least 100 hours in this game. The worst part is that the roster is so small no-one can perfectly counter mercy. Widowmaker would be great for this but guess what, she’s not in the roster!



2. Weapon & Power Boosts: Attack Speed Boosts? Annoying but fine, Cooldown Reducers? Rare. But my lord, do Power and attack boosts need either a higher price increase, or a Cap. Only way to exceed the cap is to use the special ability modifiers Otherwise you can’t exceed the cap. Sure some characters could use damage boosts, but maybe Cassidy, Reinhardt, and Soldier 76 can have a slight nerf in dmg boosts. I was playing genji and there was a cassidy who just got one headshot and one shot me, he had 40% dmg boost… A FORTY PERCENT DAMAGE BOOST.



3. Anyone who plays Orisa, [D.va](http://d.va), Kiriko, Mercy, Moria, Cassidy, and mei Exclusively for their stupid amounts of op powerups, Go touch Grass.



4: Ana: This is a generally personal issue with Ana in general but I will continue, I am under the personal idea that you shouldn’t have an ability that makes one aspect of the game unable to work for 12 seconds. Ana’s nade is already annoying. What makes it worse is when she sleeps you first. I believe that she should have a heal reducing nade not a heal canceling nade. You have the code for it to work. Just fix it.   
  


5. Moria. I think by this consensus: If a character has a high healing output, give them either low health with few ways to make it back, or give them low dps. Moria ignores BOTH of these. That paired with the no-skill auto aim being a part of her main weapon and her biotic orbs make these annoying already. That paired with the fact that she gets a get out of jail free card with no way of figuring out where she went besides an audio cue which lets face it you won’t hear while a whole war is being fought.6: Genji: Genji is very, very bad in stadium. Even though I still play him I will admit he is terrible. His dragonblade is almost never able to be used, even then it can barely 2 hit Supports, and his abilities suck to use when your just starting out Sure I can “Play a different game or hero” But why don’t you guys get off of fortnight and reddit when you lose a game  and then go on a rant about how the weapon is completely broken. I know that is Ironic coming from this video, but I feel like I am making a pretty good point. 7: Upgrades. Sure stadium is fun but I want more experimentation, sure the whole thing is more arcade like game. But the whole power system is a little… eh… I’m not trying to dunk on the programmers because I know that it takes time to write game code. I want more powers that change your abilities, make genji’s dash make him turn around and slash again but make it deal 50% less damage, Make moria’s fade able to blind someone for a quick second, make mercy unplayable, Make [d.va](http://d.va) pilotable while self destruct is online for a little bit longer at the cost of her life.

The Point is overwatch 2 is not perfect, and frankly it will never be. Blizzard will constantly try to ‘fix the issue’ but make 50 more. I believe that CircletoonsHD said it best. Blizzard created a game so bad that the community got  hyped saying overwatch was back when loot boxes were implemented. So what should blizzard do? I don’t know, I'm a thirteen year old who is weirdly obsessed with fancy lighters.

Can we have a civil discussion?,Overwatch,0,1kkwz5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kkwz5r/can_we_have_a_civil_discussion/,41,2025-05-12 18:30:27,"Hey everyone! I've been a long time OW player, playing the game since it's initial release back in 2016. It was the first FPS team shooter I've ever played and I thought it was a cool new and exciting change. Met a lot of people and made a lot of friends because of it. Years of playing and getting better with time, there was an announcement that overwatch 2 was going to happen. I was excited about it because I felt OW was a pretty solid game. I was wrong.

They things that they promised, like having a story mode you can play with your friends, never happened as far as I am concerned. On top of that, the Ow I have grown to love was gone. A game I paid money for was erased and I was forced into a game that I didn't even get to try out beforehand. I was robbed in a financial since, never again able to play a game that I paid for. Then there's just being robbed of fun? 

I played the game it wasnt too bad the initial drop date. My friends and I grumbled about it but we trucked along. Changes to heros I could live with like Orisa and her Javalin with the loss of a shield barrier. Even Doom becoming DPS. But, more changes came and I was getting more irritated. The biggest change was the player base. All of the OG players started dropping off because they hated the changes and I couldn't blame them. In came a new player base.

Many of them I met were one trick ponies and played the game like it was COD. The game felt like it was ushering in a new team dynamic which was actually not being a team. Supporting a play style that encouraged many players to be ""solo"" in a five (no longer 6 until recent updates) player team. Now there are bans because it's ""too hard and annoying"" to combat characters like symetra and Sombra? Isn't the whole point of comp and team based games is to work together to beat other players and the opposing team? I feel like this game is dead and no longer fun.

Maybe a lot of you'd don't feel the way I feel but I would love to hear your opinions regardless. As the title reads keep it civil. "

Climbed from Bronze to Diamond on support. I'm just so glad i never left, even during the last 2 years of Overwatch 1 content drought.

No game ever hit all the buttons as well as Overwatch did and now does so well. There are so many things to learn and experience in the game: mechanical skill, situational awareness, meta strategies, counter swap/adapting to enemy or team, sense of community, etc. 

I watched OWL and now OWCS and elite Overwatch is just beautiful to watch. 

The game has been so good recently, especially with perks, stadium, and regular patches. I've been having so much fun. The only regret i have is that I work full time now and barely have time to play. 

To the devs, thank you for not giving up on Overwatch. I love that it's free to play and not pay to win. If the skins make money and help keep the game going, I'm all for it. For now i'm quite happy with the Battle Pass and haven't spent money on collabs yet (but maybe if a LOTR collab drops i won't be able to resist)."

I started up Street Fighter 6 for the first time in a while when I heard a familiar humming noise in the beginning of ""Not on the Sidelines"" (Street Fighter 6 Main Theme). It turns out that humming noise is the same that plays when you boot up Overwatch 2

NOTE: I couldn't find footage of booting up Overwatch so I had to go on GeForce Now and record the footage on my phone. It doesn't take long to load on PC so you might have to turn your volume up. It's more noticable on consoles which usually have a longer loading time.

Can someone check this and see if I have permanent Headhunter perk active?,Overwatch,0,1kkg6m5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kkg6m5/can_someone_check_this_and_see_if_i_have/,1,2025-05-12 03:02:54,"Story:

I think I discovered a bug that caused Ana to permanently have the Headhunter perk—not just for a single match, but across every game I played. Even after a restart of the game.

Unfortunately, I have no idea what triggered it. I didn’t do anything out of the ordinary—just played as usual.

Changing perks didn’t seem to make a difference; Headhunter remained active, even right at the start of each round. By the end of the matches, it felt like I had three perks active at once.

This was in competitive 6v6 mode. Now the icon is not there, but it FEELS like I'm doing too much damage?

I made a bug report here: [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/bug-ana-permanent-headhunter-perk-even-after-restart/964516](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/bug-ana-permanent-headhunter-perk-even-after-restart/964516)

I don’t know—am I just imagining things? I’m not really winning more, and I’m not sure my stats are actually better. Maybe just a bit better than usual? But I do feel I'm winning duels that I shouldn't.

Before, you'd usually have a 2-2-2 comp on your team, but now the enemy team always gets it while your team ends up with 4 DPS.

Not to mention those players who select support to fill, then immediately switch to Ashe when they die. If you want to play DPS just pick your character from the start. Don’t make us lose the first fight for free.

The difference in team coordination is also insane. When I get a kill from an off-angle and try to return to my team, the enemy Zarya will chase me to spawn and no one on my team will even try to help. But when someone flanks and attacks me, no one on my team turns around. The ping button is literally useless, it's like my teammates are deaf.

Thanks & Clarifications To My Support Sombra Rework,Overwatch,0,1kjd8co,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kjd8co/thanks_clarifications_to_my_support_sombra_rework/,1,2025-05-10 17:43:26,"Hey everyone,

Thank you to all who engaged with my Sombra support rework proposal. Whether you agreed or not, I appreciate the constructive feedback and discussions.

**Addressing Damage Concerns**  
  A common concern is that this rework significantly reduces Sombra’s damage. In reality, her bodyshot damage sees an approximate 18% reduction, balanced by new healing and utility capabilities. She retains high output potential through headshots and strategic use of her Virus ability. For comparison, heroes like Zenyatta, Kiriko, and Baptiste can achieve similar or higher damage when played skillfully. This rework emphasizes precision and timing over raw burst.  
  Moreover, the reduced damage lessens the frustration of sudden eliminations from stealth. If a Sombra chooses to engage from invisibility, the extended engagement window allows teammates more opportunity to react and assist, introducing risk to aggressive plays and encouraging more thoughtful decision-making.

**Clarifying Dual-Use Abilities**  
  Both Hack and Virus can target allies and enemies, but their functions are distinct and intuitive. A straightforward input determines the target type, and abilities behave differently based on the target—either aiding a teammate or debuffing an opponent. Cooldowns adjust accordingly, rewarding smart and flexible play without overwhelming complexity.  
  Regarding Virus, its dual-use design isn’t bloated. It requires precise positioning to avoid being blocked by teammates, and if it does get blocked, the cooldown reduction on ally hits mitigates the penalty, maintaining a fair balance between challenge and usability.

**Rationale for the Change**  
  This rework leans into Sombra’s original identity—disruption and team impact over burst eliminations from stealth. In Overwatch 2, her constant ability shutdowns, sudden ambushes, and frequent escapes have made her feel frustrating even when not overpowered. Shifting her into a support role preserves her agility and cleverness, but channels them into more deliberate, team-focused plays.

And to those saying “lore-wise she shouldn’t be healing”—really? It’s 2025. Sombra’s been healing since day one with hacked health packs. Brigitte heals allies by inspiring them with vibes. Let’s not pretend lore is some sacred gameplay barrier now. Besides, Sombra’s entire role in Infiltration and A Great Day is support-adjacent—she gathers intel, sets up plays, and operates from the shadows. She’s never been the main gun. That doesn’t mean she can’t shoot—it means she knows when to. This rework just brings that narrative into her kit, where it’s always quietly lived.

**Considering Current Players**  
  Some worry this shift might alienate existing Sombra players, but role changes aren’t new—Doomfist’s rework is proof that change can benefit overall game health, even if not everyone embraces it.  
  This rework isn’t meant to satisfy every Sombra main. It’s geared toward OG players and those who already lean into her utility and supportive playstyle—not just through perks like White Hat, but in mindset. If you’re someone who enjoys high-lethality flanks every six seconds, this rework probably isn’t for you—and that’s okay.

Support Sombra doesn’t erase her identity. It refocuses it in a way that lowers frustration, promotes decision-making, and still rewards smart, high-impact play. That’s worth considering, not dismissing.

**Why Support?**  
  I’m not asserting that Sombra must become a support. These ideas stem from exploring viable solutions, and my documentation elaborates on why a support shift is plausible. It’s not the sole path but a potential avenue for Blizzard to consider, especially given multiple reworks as a DPS haven’t resolved existing issues.  
  If you have concepts for a DPS rework, please share them in the comments. Let’s discuss their viability concerning both Sombra players and the broader community’s experience facing her. The objective is to develop a healthier version of Sombra. Currently, despite being under-tuned, her playstyle can leave a negative impression. Many Sombra mains, myself included, believe that reducing her lethality and utility uptime—not utility value—is a constructive direction.

This rework focuses on these principles. It’s not the only solution but a feasible one. I encourage you to assess the kit’s viability rather than focusing solely on role preference. Not all supports are traditional healers; this Sombra can still achieve game highlights and substantial kill and damage stats, akin to heroes like Zenyatta or Kiriko.

These portraits were the only reason that made me play overwatch, i was literally feeling the grind even if i’m not playing ranked, unfortunately i stopped at level 83 and 5 silver stars. 

Now every time i check my profile I always see my OW1 portraits and think of it that i really wanted to get the platinum portrait, which was the last portrait that you can get. 

I’m not a big fan of the new level system, i have now reached level 1000 after 3 years of playing overwatch 2 which is so slow, hell even sometimes i have to play 15 or 20 matches just to level my hero, i’m at level 87 with Mercy and i cant level her that much, i get 1 level every 15-20 matches. 
 
I really need something to grind other than ranked and stadium which I don’t usually play.

Why didn't overwatch make placement games for stadium? It's such an amazing game mode but it feels like there are always 1 or 2 players WAY above the rest of the teams.

It's frustrating,  Impossible to learn anything from the experience and going 3 to 4 rounds of just getting deleted is just off putting and feels like i would have just had a better experience playing QP. 

I dunno, I guess I just cannot believe I'm that bad that lose 80% of my stadium matches no mater which role. My ranked ranking is gold 1 (i know I'm still bad but surely not that bad?)"

The Ban System is short sighted and naive.,Overwatch,0,1kiwij3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kiwij3/the_ban_system_is_short_sighted_and_naive/,34,2025-05-10 01:33:40,"Lets assume the goal of a ""Ban System"" in any competitive shooter is to encourage creativity, by introducing limitations. This a normal thing that happens all the time - some of the most creative things in the world were done under strict limitations.

In a game like siege, it works, because characters arent differentiated drastically. If you can play one character, you can likely play another just as well, and while it will have an impact on how the round plays out, in terms of how sites are taken or defended, it doesn't have an impact on how well you as a player does.

In a game like overwatch, its a mess. For several reasons:

1. Characters are so drastically different that a person can actually play a single character and be awful at the rest. In overwatch 1, this was a problem that was solved by some people just not ranking up as high, and in overwatch 2 this was solved by reducing just how hard some characters countered others. (most drastically, the tanks) there are no hard counters in overwatch 2, minus 1 or 2 characters. Im going to say this very simply: It is okay for someone to want to play one character and nothing else. It is okay for r/SombraMains to *only* play sombra. It is not your or anyone elses business how someone engages with a product. They bought (or downloaded) the same game and put the same investment into it you did, and they are and should be allowed to play it how they see fit. If that means they get locked into bronze, so be it. Play more ranked. you'll rank up. The people hardstuck in gold arent the reason *you* are hardstuck in gold. *you are*.

2. Its so incredibly shortsighted. Picking your preferred character has one of two impacts: Either they dont ban that character because you want to play it (as you can see from r/SombraMains thats pretty unlikely, as finding 9 random people in however big your matchmaking pool is that is okay with playing against sombra is pretty fucking unlikely) or worse, **they purposefully ban your character**. This is another avenue for people to grief you, and what exactly is a report going to do in this instance? This isn't ""This guy sat around in spawn"". If they say nothing and just ban your character, you are shit out of luck. They are not going to get punished. And i know this happens, because I just got out of a game where someone *told me* they were going to ban my character. And for every person that tells you they are doing something, there are *more* that dont.

3. It doesn't encourage creativity. It has already shown that people will instead just ban what they dont like and move on. It has nothing to do with creativity. It has nothing to do with finding creative ways to solve problems, and everything to do with arbitrarily letting people remove characters they dont like play against. We had a system that encouraged creativity, and it was *ban pools*. A rotating pool of bans forces some people to, *sometimes* play new characters, and it also forces the meta to constantly rotate and evolve. You can build strong strategies in a short period of time, while not completely removing a character from existence because 90% of the community doesn't like playing *against* them.

4. It will *always* take an entire character out of play for most of the community. It saves a minority of the playerbase a headache of dealing with a character at the time (Right now sombra), and costs the entire playerbase that wants to play that character the option to do so indefinitely. Or does anyone believe that there was ever a version of sombra that wouldnt get banned?

Im not a sombra main, by the way. Just an irritated guy who really enjoys overwatch but is starting to not be able to stand competitive for this system alone. I also love overwatch, i think the *majority* of the changes since overwatch 2 have been good for the game. But this is just a shortsighted system."

Do people even like the bans? Do we really need it or are we just in need of a crutch. (Long-Long rant),Overwatch,0,1kioeej,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kioeej/do_people_even_like_the_bans_do_we_really_need_it/,31,2025-05-09 19:36:11,"Returned to the game from about a 5 month break, been spending some time in the game, the big new thing to me are the bans. What i mean in the title is this; do you really have a problem with for ex; sombras or you have problems with inadaquate teammates unable to deal with a sombra. Or the powerful abilities of a sombra not being checked by devs for months. Either of the way, i view this system as a crutch. 

**The personal prerogative**  
I play ashe, i play widow, i play ana a lot, occasionally if i wanna play tank i play dva or zarya. I haven't played tank recently so i practically never get my heroes banned unless somebody just really doesn't want a Ana.

I don't mind sombras, tracers when i widow or ana, obviously when i'm not all there and or it's to much i must change accordingly, but more often then not it's a fun cat and mouse game, knowing how sombras play, when and where they would be coming from, etc, on widow i would often suprise a sombra just having a spider sense kick in that i got off from years of playing against them, knowing how they approach things, while playing widow i had the most respectful and fun chats with enemy sombras and tracers. This is my own prerogative, i understand that, it's just to say over the years, since 2017 I've been playing we've just had to get used to these heroes, that people pick them on my or on the enemies team. As a widow player the sombra bans on paper is good for me, but it still feels like a cope out given the state of the game, it doesn't feel like a given, more like it's been forced into the cracks of the water tank hoping it'll stop the leakage.. 



I often stare at my ban options and feel like banning nothing, i may be weird but i just like playing against heroes that aren't exactly easy to play against. I'm banning the heroes other people want to ban, everytime sombra, doom, dva, zarya, mercy, sometimes ana, sometimes freya but always the same general heroes of 6-8. The trend remained the same going from plat 1 to masters 2. Everybody just bans the same heroes. The only time i see a widow ban is on junkertown or when somebody has unreasonable arachnophobia. It's always the same cycle of heroes. The few times when sombra wasn't banned the sombra's that played got annihilated because everybody focused her. Everytime i ask people in the match if they like bans, they just say ""I hate XYZ players so i ban them"" not even the characters, the players.

League has 170 champions - 10 bans/ match, it’s warranted. Overwatch has 43 heroes split across three roles to a lager degree favoring dps heroes, like i'm not gonna cry if you ban widow, i've got ashe, i've got cree, i've got a lot of options of the same caliber generally doing the similar actions from the same branch, but you ban ana ? That's a entire play style banned off the role, there is just no subsidiary to that play style, same is true for any of the heroes of the two most affected roles of bans, tank/support. If someone only plays a certain subset of heroes wich we all do, very, very few people play anything more then like 5 heroes on the regular accross all roles, a few bans remove all of them. It’s not even about counterplay anymore it’s just trimming rosters because matchmaking or meta balance isn't doing its job. 

**So again, do people even** ***like*** **the bans? Or are we just using it as a crutch for problems tucked beneath the bed ?**"

I’m so sick of the Juno/Kiri/Mercy “Skinpocalypse”,Overwatch,0,1kikew1,https://youtu.be/schtk917iRU?si=_QzgSU5BCogjXLfF,22,2025-05-09 16:51:46,"
So the new street fighter 6 collaboration was announced today, which is very exciting news. So many underrated characters (cosmetically and popularity wise) finally got some more love (seriously, the Sigma M. Bison is genius). 

Seeing the trailer essentially open up with Juno was so annoying already, but I was hopeful. What really got me was the second we saw the Kiriko kunai. At what point is a character getting too many skins *in general*? At some point you gotta get tired of the same 3 characters having 20+ legendary skins and mythic skins, right??????

Overwatch 2 will not die if Juno, Mercy, and Kiriko go ONE SEASON/COLLAB without getting a new skin. At first it was funny, but it’s just sad at this point. I genuinely cannot remember the last time characters like Lucio, Soujourn, Lifeweaver, Symmetra, Roadhog, and Zarya got any amount of love from collabs or even just skins in general. There have been so many collab-specific skins that would have looked better on different characters than the “big 3” (still not over the fact that Symmetra didn’t get a Katara skin for the Avatar collab, but I digress) or there were so many collabs where other characters from said collab would work better with under appreciated characters.

I understand these 3 characters are the “most popular,” but come on. Replace these 3 characters with any of the aforementioned under appreciated ones and I promise the hype would be through the roof. I can’t get outta bed for these 3 characters anymore; it’s more than just “don’t buy their skins lol” when they get one. Every. Single. Time. 

P.S. for the people who cannot go 3 seconds without mentioning profits in chat: we will never truly know if a (MODERN) collab or even just a vanilla season release will be a commercial failure or success if they will never stop giving the same 3 characters legendary skins. 

I really challenge blizzard to got 1 season without a single Mercy, Kiriko, or Juno skin. This will never happen, but if them not getting their 8th skins IN A ROW means another character will get their first? I’ll be over the moon.

Sincerely,
A very agitated Symmetra, Lucio, and Zarya fan."

So I was wondering,Lifeweaver has received a lot of buffs and he's in a better spot overall. But is there still something missing from his kit?

I think there's still a lack of consistency between his weapon swap for healing and damage. Take other supports as examples:

Kiriko’s auto-recharge healing has a 0.9-second window, and during that time, you can throw two kunais with no real downtime.

Baptiste, similar to Kiriko, can alternate between healing and damage by using his healing recovery time to land two shots.

Moira and Illari can heal and deal damage instantly when switching between their primary and secondary fire while managing their healing resources. 

Juno and Ana can both heal or damage simply by aiming at allies or enemies.

Brig, Zen, and Lucio all provide AoE passive or ability-based healing while dealing damage at the same time.


The only supports left with separate weapon-swapping mechanics are Mercy and Lifeweaver. But Mercy compensates with her damage boost as a secondary fire.

Now, Lifeweaver, on the other hand, has to manually ""prepare"" his healing every time. His kit lacks fluidity between damage and healing. He’s also the only hero in the game whose inactive weapon reloads slower than if you were actively using it—2.5 seconds when swapping vs. 1.5 seconds manually. That just feels unnecessary.

So I thought, why not bring his weapons more in line with other supports? My goal is to minimize downtime between damage and healing while keeping the feel of charging his heals.


---

Here are my ideas (still open to suggestions):

● Healing Blossom:

1. Passive charging now only begins when Thorn Volley is active, and during its use, the charge time remains the same at 1.15 seconds.

2. Ammo is only consumed if the projectile is released.

3. Automatic reload time for the inactive weapon reduced from 2.5s to 1.5s.

4. Weapon swap animation smoothed out and made more responsive.


Why?

1. These changes promote a more aggressive Lifeweaver playstyle. Like Kiriko or Bap, the time you would take to charge a heal can now be used to deal some damage, which keeps things consistent. 


2. There’s no reason to spend ammo if no projectile is fired.


3. Some may suggest infinite ammo for Blossom—I considered it, but for now, I prefer giving players a bit of skill expression through reload management. Still open to changing this.


4. The healing/damage swap feels clunky because it’s not tied to a truly primary/secondary fire, so smoother animation is something that the animators needs to ajust.

These proposed changes aim to make Lifeweaver’s gameplay more fluid and rewarding, allowing him to better balance healing and damage without feeling clunky. By promoting a more aggressive playstyle and addressing issues like ammo consumption and weapon swapping, we can make Lifeweaver feel more consistent and responsive in combat.

Other kit suggestions:

● Healing (Tree, Blossom, Dash): Now delivers instant burst healing.

Based on the wiki and workshop data, there’s a 0.3s HoT in healing. Switching to instant burst could improve responsiveness as a QoL change.


● Life Grip: Now cleanses negative effects.

Honestly, this should be in his base kit, not just as a perk.


● Petal Platform:

Crouching on an idle platform no longer activates it.

Interact button no longer destroys it—hold the activation button for 0.3s to remove it.

Interact button now makes platform descend, even with a player on it.

Idle platforms can now be raised by pressing Interact (no one needs to step on it) and it remains in the air until interact is pressed again in this case.


These changes aim to make the platform more strategic and bring back tactics like lifting turrets or Winston’s bubble, without breaking current mechanics and improving general control.Note that these changes do not change the way it is activated and deactivated (activates when someone goes up, deactivates when someone step out of it) but just adds an extra control to the abiliity.


● Tree of Life: First pulse healing increased from 150 to 180.
To keep up with the general HP buff and stay consistent with the 90 HP per pulse.


---

Perk adjustments:

Removed:

• Cleansing Grasp

• Lifeweaving


New Minor Perk:
• Care from Afar: Increases the range of Life Grip and Healing Blossom by 35%.

Simple, but very useful.

New Major Perk:
• Rejuvenating Platform: Petal Platform reloads allies' ammo and grants infinite ammo while standing on it.

This is meant to give the platform more utility. Initially, I thought about increasing fire rate, but this idea feels more unique.

• Superbloom (rework):
Instead of needing to hit 20 projectiles to trigger an explosion, now every 20th projectile is explosive, dealing small AoE damage (2m radius).

This makes it more consistent and effective against grouped enemies or objects.

That’s it!
Sorry for the long text, but I wanted to explain the reasoning behind each change. I’d love to hear your feedback or any counterarguments.
Good games everyone!"
New to competitive: stadium blues,Overwatch,0,1khxixs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1khxixs/new_to_competitive_stadium_blues/,7,2025-05-08 20:33:19,"EDIT: My gf asked me to queue a few stad games with her, and I had a lot of fun this time. Maybe I just don’t like solo queueing that mode. Thank you for your feedback! I’ll remember it’s just about doing my best and having fun. :) And I’ll take a break if I start panicking and it ruins the experience. 

I have about 250 hrs in Overwatch 2. It’s my first shooter, and my aim isn’t very good so I tend to stick with very straight-forward, accessible-to-beginners characters (mercy, Juno, and soldier are my most played). 

When I first played stadium and got placed in rookie 3 or 4, I thought it was really fun but still engaging enough for me to break a sweat sometimes. I’ve since been placed contender 3 for support, and I hate playing stadium now. I’ve tried a few other characters but I end up just playing support and picking Juno or Mercy bc they’re what I’m best at. Even then, my healing and damage are ass and I feel like my team is carrying me / I’m really bringing them down. Since I’ve ranked up, I always have the lowest amount of cash (is that equivalent to how much “value” you had in that round?) and more often than not, the least healing out of the supports. I’ve since looked into best builds that would support my team comps and my style of playing, but I don’t know if it’s helped at all.

No one’s said anything to me, but I know I could be doing more for my team. My poor mood affects my decision-making, so I end up doing stupid things like going for reckless rezzes or panicking and using my movement ability just to save myself rather than to help get my teammates out. 

Is this just what it’s like to play in higher ranks (higher just meaning higher than the lowest, which is what I’m used to)? I feel so miserable and guilty all the time, and it makes me not want to play the game anymore. 

If it’s just me and this isn’t a normal feeling, what can I do to stay calm during matches and support my team more? "

I know that the team is busy with the improvements to the game and now stadium, but stadium just has proven that they have a bunch of tools, that they can use, and maybe could lend even some to the community to light up a second spark of hope for Overwatch workshop (you could say Overwatch Workshop 2) great examples are - Attack speed, modifying an abilities % or its variables mid game

And even a feature that seems little but can improve immersion of custom games - CHOOSING A CUSTOM SKIN FOR A HERO, people could make a more believable version of their own mirrorwatch or just Omnics VS Humans with the omnic skins.

Maybe I am just a bias lover of the workshop but it has decayed and become a rotten body of what it was.

My issues from the game became apparent when I started getting into matches while on plat, and noticed that the rank range is a bit too far off from each other, I once had a plat 2, and a silver 2 in a lobby with me, and this keeps happening to my matches where I would have teammates who are in plat as well, who play like this is the first match of their life, or seem like absolute brand new players, I've had many games where player's would be oblivious to game mechanics like doomfist gauntlet charge up, and zarya bubble charge, while they are in plat.

My matches now for the past few months has been completely one sided, and it never feels like a balanced match making. Having encountered teams in groups while my while team being mostly solos. This does not seem fair as having teams in groups to communicate with each other is at such an advantage, while the solos do not have this opportunity directly. It would seem more fair to have matches that advocate solo teams vs solo teams and groups vs groups instead, however this does not seem like the case.

Another issue I am having is that I have noticed something that seems unfair in the game, where if you had capped the point first, and has brought it high in numbers, like 20%, the team that over takes the point seems to have a higher rate of percentage, where after losing one team fight against the overtaking team, they would easily reach 80% with the same amount of time it takes for the first capped team to reach 20. This does not seem fair to a degree.

Last issue I am having is that the ban system seems to be randomized to some degree, I had many occasions when my team would ban 2 hero's collectively, but the minority vote was pushed into the final choice, which does not make sense. 

I am on a 30 game plus losing streak and these issues are very hard to deal with at times"

Disclaimer: these are the builds that worked for me. Maybe there are better ones out there according to your own playstyle. I adjusted the build according my performance and the enemy team. For example, if I was Genji against Zarya, I used the item anti beam coating. If I was against Orisa I used the item shield buster. If I was support against soldier, I used the item iron eyes.

Here are some builds I used:

**Tanks**

* **Reinhart:** I did my own version of fire-strike and ability power: magma strike->impact burst->blatzing blitz. Items: chimera maw, rocket strike, dampener grip 
* **Junker queen:** I won with the build of [misciagna021](https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1k75zic/asking_for_stadium_junker_queen_builds/) (check the comments)
* **Orisa:** I won with the build of [Halex00](https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1k635ld/stadium_orisa_fortify_build_guide/) 
* **D.va:** I suffered a lot and tried many builds, I won with the build by [Blaky039](https://stadiumbuilds.io/build/f963a427-d21b-42cc-a7b2-45e246713cee)
* **Zarya:** check the comments for the build by [Lostbasin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k6qt2o/whats_a_good_dva_and_zarya_build_for_stadium/). Very funny build.

  
**Healer**

* Ana: Powers: no scope->pinpoint prescription->your full potential. Items: potent projectiles, unscope resources, aftermarket firing pin+ ammo, or survival stuff
* **Mercy:** after many attempts, I was able to win with the tank build by [Hina-Wolf.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MercyMains/comments/1k5w4p7/can_we_start_a_thread_for_our_favorite_mercy/) (search his/her comment)
* **Moira:** orb build works (please don't pick multiball first), but I liked this build by [Arx\_UK](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoiraMains/comments/1kdsox2/overwatch_2_stadium_moira_build_survival_is_the/)
* **Kiriko:** easy with Powers: two-zu->cleansing charge -> keen kunai. Items: talisman of life, talisman of velocity + survival stuff
* **Juno:** I did [Aspen build](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GpWJssaWQAACbdX?format=jpg&name=large), extremely funny and powerful build.
* **Lucio:** it was easy with Powers:  radio edit -> crowd pleaser -> reverb. Items: #1 single, lofly beats + survival stuff

**DPS**

* **Reaper:** it was the first day of stadium, so I did the example build :P shotgun reaping. I saw better builds in my matches.
* **Soldier 76:** it was the first day of stadium, and I did my version of healing run build. Iam sure there are better builds out there.  I saw better builds in my matches.
* **Mei:** great build and guide by [Ninjapug7](https://www.reddit.com/r/MeiMains/comments/1k9q65x/mei_stadium_build_strike/)
* **Cassidy:** it took me many attempts. I did the example build ""vigilante gunslinger""m but I picked full house as my second power, and I got weapon power and ammo items.
* **Ashe:** it took me many attempts. The only match I wont at round 7. Powers: out with a bang->molten ammunitions->bob jr. Items: silver lighter (or furnace fuel if there is kiriko), firestarter, infrared lenses, stacked sticks
* **Genji:** extremely difficult for me. I won with: hanamura healing -> laceration -> wyrms maw -> spirit of sojiro. Items: ability power + traversal kinetics + deflecting dash

So we know Stadium is more toxic than normal and that the best solution is to just mute people. What are some behaviors you use to souse out problematic people and mute them while being open to others?,Overwatch,0,1keuoi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1keuoi3/so_we_know_stadium_is_more_toxic_than_normal_and/,16,2025-05-04 23:17:04,"Obviously it's not viable to come up with a ""code of ethics"" for people to follow to not be toxic. Conversely however ""Just mute everyone"" can stand to be refined given the importance of coordination in competitive settings.

So I'm thinking ""What are some behaviors in Overwatch that are red flags for toxicity?""

1. *Making demands instead of requests at the start of a match.* If I see ""join vc"", that's purely imperative; a red flag to not join. ""please join vc"" is safer since they're at least being mindful about manners when time allows. Similar is when a teammate tells another one to switch; a sign of micromanaging others.
2. *Interpreting declarative statements as demands (or interpreting the use of periods as aggression).* If I type ""Making callouts in vc"", that does not demand that anyone joins and is meant to imply that I'm fine with that outcome. A response of ""who asked"" to anything purely informational is always worth a mute.
3. *People with first-round criticisms.* First round is just spicy normal Overwatch and is a very poor indicator of long-term performance. It's okay to say what you're struggling with, like ""Orisa predicted my power"" or ""Their Soldier keeps flanking me"". The people that are like ""gg our Rein is feeding"" or ""our Cass can't aim"" however, have some idea of a teammate cemented in their mind that they're unwilling to change. Mute.
4. *People with non-constructive second-round criticisms.* Pointing out mistakes is always best paired with either an explanation of why it's a mistake or some way to fix it. Second round is still a bit early for indicators of long-term performance, but if we're like 5% away from the mercy rule being triggered next round, I'll try to figure out how to resolve teammate's issues. Of course, any teammate that complains about other teammates' performance without trying to help them gets a mute.

Naturally I'm probably gonna get some people declaring my snap judgements, lack of forgiveness, and pompous-sounding prose here to be red-flag behavior, but this discussion is all about finding reasons to preemptively mute people; so to them I say ""You've found your reason to mute me."""
"Concerns about Dive, Stadium, and Winston's addition",Overwatch,2,1kenwn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kenwn1/concerns_about_dive_stadium_and_winstons_addition/,5,2025-05-04 18:29:07,"So right now we technically have the ability to have a dive comp, but in practice we really don't. In a couple of seasons, we'll have Winston be added, the key enabler of dive.

Why am I concerned? Well... You can't swap. And dive is MISERABLE to play into on a lot of heroes. To be honest, it's miserable to play into as anything but a dive mirror(and even dive mirrors sometimes dedicated enablers who are also victim heroes, like Ana and Zen, but that's another discussion entirely). Yes, there are ways to play into it, even on the heroes who do the worst into dive, but it's not an enjoyable experience. And again, you can't swap, and you'll be stuck in it for multiple rounds.

Combine that with how small these maps are in stadium, meaning that dive will counter non dive and non brawl comps even harder, and brawl will counter dive even harder, making balancing dive a very difficult thing to do in relation to the comps it's countered by and the comps it's strong into.

It also means that it's impossible to position outside of dive's range on most of these maps due to their size. They'll have access to their targets whenever they want essentially.

Ok. To state it more clearly, my concerns are, in order of importance in my opinion:

1) The player experience for non-dive players into dive

2) The general balance of dive in stadium

I think it's definitely possible for them to do, especially if they add items and perks, but it's something that they need to be careful of and focus on. That's sort of why i'm calling it out, especially since there's not really any super easy answers.

Returning to competetive after 7 years,Overwatch,5,1kembuq,https://i.redd.it/vhgsu1iy7sye1.png,2,2025-05-04 17:21:56,"So, I've been playing overwatch ever since 2016. I've never been to PvP much since old LAN counterstrike, but I've played lots of co-operative multiplayer like Mass effect 3 and Dragon age:Inquisition. So team playing wasn't a foreing concept to me.

I went trough first iteration of competetive overwatch, including the infamous ""Sudden Death""-mechanic. This was before ranks or placement matches were implemented, the nonsensical 0-100 ranking.But despite of this, I didn't give up. I kept playing around 3 years, specializing tanks: shield tanks in paticular. I started with Winston, then moved to Reinhardt, Orisa (back then, she was a shield tank) and Sigma. I spent most of it in high silver, always few wins away from gold.

What finally did kill my interest to try competetive, was that I felt that I was rewarded too little for amount of work I put in and punished unreasonably for even one loss. progress gained in three wins seemed neglible, while a loss could almost wipe out 90% progress I had made.

Furthermore, my work-life balance made it impossible to dedicate the time I'd want to improve my skills. Work took around 10-12 hours of my time (commutes were a PAIN) so it felt like I couldn't progress anyway, so there wasn't much point. Season 9, 2018 was my last competetive season.

Ever once in a while, I felt like I should try to make a comeback, but then whenever I did warmup on quick play, I just lost any appetite for it. So for 7 years, I kept just playing QP, doing events, arcade and special game modes. By Overwatch 2, introdcution of 5v5 made again wanting to try competetive, but I always felt that ""time wasn't right.""

Until now. 

Now after 7 years from last competetive match and Stadium update.....I felt that now is the time to return. I kept my expectations modest: I wanted just to get to gold, whatever division, because that was my goal for 3 years, but always out of reach. And predictions for my placements based on my MMR(or at least I think they predict them on MMR)seemed to be on my side. 

How did I do? Well, I shattered all expectations and shot to Platinum on all ranks, except DPS, allthough even there I scored two tiers higher than expected. Experience has been suprisingly positive.

When I did my Tank placements, compared to how me and the other tank always seemed to be blamed to everything in 6v6, now it was non-existant. Once, I got Brigitte mouthing off telling i'm a bronze tank (with KD-ratio of 25/5, D.va-I definetely had bad games in my placements, but that wasn't nearly my worst) Which I just replied that better a bronze tank than a feeder Brig. How the hell you end up dying over 10 times asa brig anyway?  Some of it probably is the new score system, instead of pointless medals of OW1, So tanks aren't blamed as often to be as they used to.

Now, playing as DPS, it was even less than that: I was allowed to misplay and no one seemed to care. I wasn't even once blamed of anything, which I kinda find weird, given that DPS is my least played and weakest role. Not by much, but still. I was once asked to switch, pretty politely even, but otherwise no one seemed to much care.

Entirely different story in support, though. Despite that it somehow ended up my highest rank, there was more blamers there than two roles combined and always DPS players. They not only demanded to be pocketed but outright expected it, even if they played in zero angles they expected to be bailed out and demanded that I switch where as doing nothing to adapt themselves. This was still minority of what it used to be, but still notable.

Something else I noticed was almost total absent of voice comms, but then again, as I play in europe, that's always been bit sparser. 

Now open Q....damn, that was a mess. Of ten placement matches, we had six leavers (2 on other side, 4 on my side.) I still somehow ended up in plat. What I also noticed, which might be due to recent comp-drives, is that there are A LOT of players what I call ""dim diamonds"": players who have been diamonds inprevious season, but have deranked all the way to plat, according to those who had their profiles public. What I was suprised that there was even masters there.

Maybe Blizzard should seriously contemplate Derank protections in the future for drives: I know that idea is ""High risk, high reward""-but I'm not sure if deranking a master-level player to plat so that they can stomp everyone on their way to diamond is good for anyone.

But biggest change I've noticed is in my attitude. Before going competetive just felt stressfull, but now i'm actually more enjoying it. Maybe it's because I ended up overshooting my goals, maybe because QP has starting to develop as ""sweaty comp"" or maybe it is because I now try to make something out of the losses.

Whenever I notice that the game in QP or Comp isn't being possible to win, I just start to focus on maximizing my own stats, trying just stay alive as long as possible, start to try new characters, that sort of thing. Maybe it is all of this.

Or maybe it is just because my life finally seems to be progressing somewhere. I was saddled with a job that not only took lot of time, was monotone and repetetive. The pay was decent, but I didn't seem to be going anywhere. Now? I'm studying for a new profession entirely (railroadtrack worker, if you can believe it) and I finally feel that I'm going somewhere. Maybe this is reflecting to everything i'm doing now. Who knows? Just feels like I'm progressing.

So, I'm suprised so far everything seems to have worked out well. Stadium is kinda chaotic, but it's also fun. It's easy actually to forget that it is a competetive mode.

All in all, i'm glad that I chose this time to come back and I look forward to see where this goes next.

Anniversary should be moved back to May.,Overwatch,568,1kem9m5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kem9m5/anniversary_should_be_moved_back_to_may/,67,2025-05-04 17:19:14,"There is nothing worth celebrating in October.

October 4th 2022 was the release date for Overwatch 2’s **EARLY ACCESS** (so that was a fucking lie). It was also just objectively worse in every way imaginable and the devs have spent the past 2.5 years unruining the game after they were forced to cobble something together in only a year.

PvE, the actual Overwatch 2, was cancelled in February and what was left was shit out on August 10th 2023.

Stadium, the closest we’ve gotten to anything actually like a sequel, was just now released in late April, and because Overwatch’s original release date was May 26th 2016, those two dates are close enough together to just have the Anniversary Event run through the entirety of May.

Nothing will change this year, but hopefully, for the 10th anniversary, it’s actually celebrated on its 10th anniversary.

Why the Hell would you celebrate your birthday 5 months late because your sibling was born then?

Queries regarding level resets (and qp etiquette),Overwatch,0,1kelf0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kelf0k/queries_regarding_level_resets_and_qp_etiquette/,15,2025-05-04 16:42:11,"I come to you all seeking advice. I apologize if this is the wrong place to ask, feel free to direct me elsewhere if needed!

To be frank, I am bad at games. I used to be very good at Overwatch 1 in high school, because I had a lot of free time and several friends who played it too. In this time, I leveled up a lot. Since then, I have been on hiatus for a long while, and only recently really returned to Overwatch 2. I'm having a lot of fun with it, but it must be said that a lot of time has passed and I am very much now bad at games. 

In the recent quick play matches I have been in, I have received a frankly humorous and very varied selection of criticism and roasts. I have been compared to ""a walking slab of meat"", speculated to be a quadruple amputee, and told very politely to press alt + f4, which I, being an idiot, actually tried out. 

My current speculation is that matchmaking is sorting me with players closer to my previous skill level due to the fact that I still have that high level. Is there any way I can reset my level so I can play with people that will not get their streaks ruined? I feel very rude, and am considering just limiting myself to vs AI, but that doesn't give very much battle pass progress since most challenges don't apply. I really really want those magical girl skins and am trying to farm coins to get the battle pass for free.

If it helps, I do not touch comp with a ten foot pole, but have played some stadium for the event challenges.

Is there a solution? If not, what is the proper game etiquette here? Thank you all, and know that I appreciate your advice.

TLDR: can I reset my level so that I can play with players closer to my skill level? If not, what's the polite thing to do as someone bad at games?"

First I thought it was Directx12 which does for some reason make me lag like crazy in other games but it lags even on Directx11. I have deleted the settings folder in my documents which for some reason helped but only for like 30 minutes? 

This happens even on the lowest settings possible, it does not matter what settings I choose. This problem is semi-recent, i have not downloaded anything new, everything is updated, etc etc.

I have redone my drivers. My caches. Everything.

I even reseated ram and GPU. Removed OC, changed OC, increased OC.

I CANNOT FIND OUT WHY THIS GAME HAS UNBEARABLE LAG (FPS). It makes me lose constantly. Weirdly this lag affects my ENTIRE computer. If Im browsing with overwatch it will have the same lag. 

Only thing I've noticed is this game in particular creates a massive RAM hog. I've seen this game take even 16GB of RAM. It will go back down but then also grabs 16GB+ again. On average it's taking like 8-11GB for some reason.

Doomfist isn't as Strong as People Claim (in lore),Overwatch,516,1ke55pn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1ke55pn/doomfist_isnt_as_strong_as_people_claim_in_lore/,82,2025-05-04 00:40:04,"Doomfist is strong as fuck. He's a power house, he's a big threat in the lore.

He's not number 2 in the verse. He's not second only to Sigma. This motherfucker has been beaten by a Big Monkey and a Robot. The latter being basically effortless.

Hell, Doomfist would lose to some of the weaker members of the verse if they were well coordinated.

What makes him such a threat are his assets, his control of Talon, not just his raw strength. There's a reason he's not out here fighting everyone like an anime villain, it's because he couldn't handle that fucking smoke consistently.

Doomfist has some of the most accurate lore scaling of any character. Lesser than Orisa. Lesser than or potentially equal to Winston. Equal to Mauga.

""He can punch down a Skyscraper!!"" That was stated by some random kid, and if wasn't even a guaranteed one hit. Several characters could level a skyscraper by taking out the bottom level.

Doomfist isn't even top 5 in the Overwatch verse consistently. There are characters that counter him in lore, or just fully beat him.

Glad people are unanimous on Sigma being top 1 though."
Stadium progression  breakdown.,Overwatch,10,1ke3duu,https://i.redd.it/5y5rb894vmye1.jpeg,10,2025-05-03 23:15:41,"I’ve just done the rough maths on how long a player would need to spend to go from pro - all star as I completed a game and realised how little progress you gain compared to previous ranks. 

As a preface during my previous ranks rookie - pro I had a win rate of 80%, winning 15 games to get from rookie - pro. My matchmaking times during this were roughly a minute or two. 

After checking the combined queue time of about 6-8 minutes with a roughly 30 minute stadium match, it would take someone with 80% winrate 75 games or about 45 hours of queuing/playing. 80% winrate will presumably have a couple back to back wins so this is skewed out of their favour and would take much less time. 

However, a more accurate one is 60% winrate which is what I suspect I’ll slowly drop to now that my MMR is settling and I’m dropped in lobbies with GMs and top 500s. At this is becomes 150 games or 90 hours. Again this isn’t accounting for BtB wins but at 60% I’d say it matters less so. 

That means, assuming the system does not become harder and you continue to sit at 60% win rate (very unlikely) to go from pro - legend 1 you would need to play 450 games or dedicate 270 hours to rank up in stadium. That’s over half my overwatch 2 career time. I routinely hit the equivalent ranks in normal ranked with nowhere near as many hours a season so why have they made these such a grind for no reason? "

Stadium is great! Maybe some perks need tuning?,Overwatch,0,1kdfuqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kdfuqv/stadium_is_great_maybe_some_perks_need_tuning/,2,2025-05-03 02:09:22,"Zarya is the typical tank that counters D.va but they’ve given D.va a perk that gives her 2/3 damage resistance to beams while matrix is active. You go from being smoked to being able to face tank a lot of damage in round 2. Does Zarya have an answer to that somehow?

The power buildup becomes a bit ludicrous at times, especially if the rounds reach the 7th game. At this point I’m going around with a Reinhardt with 400 health/600 armour/3200 shield, Mei (there’s always one) is a perpetual presence on the point with that snowball of hers, and those last games become huge brawls between incredibly powerful characters.

I’m liking the system a lot and I’m having fun. The gameplay tweaks help reduce downtime for most players, and I feel the cash system does capture performance better. The bounty system lets you identify the high value targets and it feels good both when you hunt the victim in question and also when you see your bounty growing and the enemy team more and more desperate to get your hide. Maybe it’s also a good way to detect smurfs?

I find it a huge positive."
Did non stadium players loose all IQ,Overwatch,0,1kdb52y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kdb52y/did_non_stadium_players_loose_all_iq/,7,2025-05-02 22:35:11,Decided I was bored and decided to play original rank 5v5 overwatch last night before bed. Decided I would try a tank I have never played in rank with. Selected Ramattra and saw the dumbest stuff from both teams the next 4 hours. In thoughts 4 hours I was averaging about 40 kills per game. It was. It skill it was almost like I was playing with bots on both teams. People on both teams all night had 0 awareness. From standing on lava to running in and trying  to 1v5 a whole team. Not once when I put my void barrier down did my teammates stand behind it. I even had a ana stand 2 feet in front of it. Next abilitys going off and both teams all night would just stand there until dead. I'm sitting here watching match replays and the things I saw last night would make multiple overwatch streams list of dumb plays. It was like I was being trolled all night by both teams. You would think by mid plat people would know fire = bad. Got 10 wins out of 12 games so not mad just confused how player's got worse in non stadium games.
How to win with every launch hero in Stadium,Overwatch,669,1kd6guh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kd6guh/how_to_win_with_every_launch_hero_in_stadium/,79,2025-05-02 19:18:20,"Finally managed to complete the Team Player challenge for the Stadium mode, so thought I'd post some tips on what builds worked best for me to help anyone struggling with this.

**Ana**

- Put everything into Weapon Power and take the Tactical Rifle power for superpowered damage and healing
- Powers-wise, go for Comfy Cloud (AoE sleep dart), Time Out (nade does knockback) and Our Turn (Nanoboost everyone in LOS). The first two help against flankers, the latter is basically a teamfight winner if you use it right.
- Put some points into Survival perks early on as you are possibly the most vulnerable support in the match most of the time.

**Ashe**

- Focus on Weapon Power and Ability Power; you will usually be sniping from the back so you don't need a ton of Survival stuff.
- Powers-wise, go for Molten Munitions and Out With A Bang first - building around Ashe's dynamite is often super effective against the deathball style fights this mode promotes
- BOB Jr is also a great pick if you find you are usually losing the first fight each round - you can swing it in your favour with the 50% ult charge requirement and gain the advantage

**Cassidy**

- Weapon Power. That's it. By midgame you want to be at 50-60% Weapon Power and you will be effectively two-tapping everything that isn't a tank.
- The Just Roll With It and Barrel Roll powers are the most useful in my opinion; don't bother with any Deadeye powers as few maps give you a good chance to use it properly.
- You can also stack ammo increase perks and combo with Full House for additional damage.

**DVA**

- The recent nerfs make the baby DVA build less viable, but my preference is to go with a missile-heavy build anyway - you want to take the Overstocked, Legendary Loadout, and Facetanking powers, then just fly at enemy squishies.
- Important - in most tank matchups, you are not going to win, so just fly into the backline and kill less mobile enemies and let your team deal with the Reinhardt or Junker Queen that is giving you grief.
- A nasty little perk for DVA is the El-Sa'ka Suppressor (epic weapon ability, middle of 3rd row), which inflicts 30% less healing on critical hits. With DVA's primary fire being so spread, your target is basically lightly anti-naded permanently while you kill them.

**Genji**

- If you're comfortable with Genji then ignore this, but if you're like me and can't land his combos to save your life, do the following - take Iaido Strike (DB slash after Deflect) as your first power and Forged Under Fire (heal from Deflect) as your second.
- You will basically be flanking, dashing into an unprotected squishy, land a couple of shurikens, and then use the DB slash after Deflect to finish them off.
- On top of this, pump points into Ability Power to buff your initial Swift Strike damage. If you are confident in landing shurikens then buff Weapon Power but I found the buffed abilities to be easier to get that burst damage with.

**Junker Queen**

- I built my JQ around Chop Chop (2 axe charges), Let's Go Win (elims reset Commanding Shout) and Reckoner's Roar (Shout wounds enemies within range). Put points into Ability Damage leading up to these.
- The order of operations with this build is basically to run at a squishy using CS's speedboost, use back-to-back axe strikes to burst them down, then reset your shout on that elim and go again.
- The enemy team is now taking constant DoT from your shout (which gets buffed by Ability Power), focused burst damage from your axe (also buffed by Ability Power) and every elim continues the combo. Just don't go for the enemy tank first with this unless they're already low.

**Juno**

- Obviously the torpedo build has been nerfed but is still super strong. Pulsar Plus is a great first round power, followed by Cosmic Coolant, and then Medicinal Missiles.
- All of your points should go into Ability Power first, Weapon Power second. If the enemy team starts shooting you out of the air with hitscan, invest in Armoured Vest, Reinforced Titanium, and Divine Intervention to up your survivability
- It is probably obvious, but make sure to use your Hyper Ring at the start of every round. Juno is one of the two heroes that can get your team to the central objective first, which is often the decider of the first fight.

**Kiriko**

- Kiriko's kunai and ofuda both count as weapons, so put everything into Weapon Power perks to boost healing and damage simultaneously.
- Two-Zu is my go-to first power, with Supported Shooting and Leaf on the Wind as secondary ones that really help sustain your frontline as they push forward
- Teamwork Toolkit (rare Weapon perk, right at the bottom of the blues) and Amari's Antidote (epic Weapon perk, 2nd row, third perk) worked really well for this build, basically help you to heal critical allies to full in one go while letting them speed themselves out of danger

**Lucio**

- Healbot Lucio is an easy win if your team is halfway competent. You can combo Reverb (two boop charges) and Crowd Pleaser (healing burst after boop) early on to save critical allies. Couple with Megaphone and Radio Edit if the match goes on that long for even greater sustain.
- There is also a broken Lucio build if you are confident in your DPS Lucio mechanics - take Reverb and Let's Bounce for a 170DMG (higher if Ability Power is buffed) burst of damage as you effectively become Doomfist and oneshot squishies by slamming them into walls.
- For perks, be looking for ability cooldown perks as much as possible to give you Amp It Up as much as possible.

**Mei**

- The devil herself, Mei's build is mostly based around spamming her Cryo-Freeze. Take Coulder, Cryclone and Frost Nova to be as annoying as possible whenever you press Shift.
- Buffing Weapon Power basically turns Mei into Cassidy after a certain point, where a single icicle crit will almost oneshot people (and no falloff!)
- Make sure you're using walls almost on cooldown - almost all of the maps have wall-sized chokepoints that make it fantastic for winning first fight and snowballing (pun intended) the round off of that.

**Mercy**

- Distortion is a favourite early power of mine, followed by Threads of Fate. You just pick whoever is your best DPS (or the tank if neither is good) and pocket-heal them. Triage Unit is good for saving allies that push a bit too far up.
- Mercy's Staff counts as a weapon, so boost Weapon damage as much as possible. Also look to nab the Caduceus Ex perk (the red epic Weapon perk) ASAP as you can stand further back from the frontline while still being connected. Also worthy of note is the Long Distance Wings perk (rare Ability, bottom row) which lets you get in and out more easily.
- Boosting whoever has significant Weapon Power perks on your team is hugely effective as they will quickly hit oneshot territory. Reinhardt and Cassidy are your best targets in my experience, but follow the money (literally, whoever has the most earnings) for a win.

**Moira**

- Moira, like DVA, has a nasty hidden combo - the Cybervenom (30% less healing) epic Ability perk makes it so her orbs inflict constant healing debuffs to basically the entire enemy team. Stack this with Cross-Orbal and every fight becomes easy.
- On your way to getting this combo, go for Empowering You and Cross-Orbal as your early powers and just pocket your frontline with orb + primary fire + damage boost until something dies, then snowball the fight. Everyone goes Multiball for some reason, I don't think it has quite the effectiveness it looks like it should have.
- Moira's left and right click are both weapons so make sure to dump extra points into Weapon Power whenever possible.

**Orisa**

- Spam the everliving hell out of Fortify and Javelin spin. Orisa is a huge counter to many tanks except Zarya, so you basically want to be surviving as long as possible on the frontline until the enemy tank breaks first.
- To this end, Factory Reset, Hooves of Steel, and Restortify work really well together - just keep an eye on the cooldowns and keep rotating between Fortify and Javelin spin depending on the amount of incoming damage
- Elite Rotator Cuff (rare Ability), Efi's Theorem (epic Ability) and as many cooldown reductions as you can get are good here. Crusader Hyraulics (rare Survival, 10% dmg reduction while you have armour) is also great because Orisa is like 90% armour health.

**Reaper**

- Do not pick the Death Blossom on teleport power. I know you want to. Every Reaper does and they instantly die every time now. Revolving Ruin, Spirited to Slay, and Wraith Renewal are far better picks in my opinion.
- You need to be able to get in close, and for that you need to be tanky. Pick Survival perks that give you overhealth, armour, and/or damage reduction early on.
- Obviously, dump a ton into Weapon Power too - not only do you deal more damage, but you also gain more lifesteal per shot, enhancing your tankiness.

**Reinhardt**

- Rein is scariest when you buff Ability and Weapon Damage stacked with Smashing! and any of the Firestrike powers.
- Look for movement/attack speed increase perks like Aftermarket Firing Pin (rare Weapon perk) and anything that makes FS scarier, like Chimera's Maw (rare Ability, 50% FS radius increase). You basically want to be almost oneshotting enemies in chokes with FS and then killing them in two swings once they get into melee range.
- If you are finding you are getting burst down a lot before you can get any damage in, look at taking the Wilhelmwagen power and Crusader Hydraulics early and stack lifesteal perks on top of that.

**Soldier 76**

- Obviously everyone knows the visor build is strong. Not sure if it still is after the nerf, but Super Visor, Peripheral Pulse, and Double Helix are great burst damage. Just try to actually hit something with the initial Helix rather than just firing it blindly to proc mini-Visor.
- Ability power increases will boost both Helix and Biotic Field, so are a good early choice. Make sure to keep on top of Weapon Power too, though, or your mini-Visors will become less effective.
- Try to adapt your weapon perks to what you're facing. Salvaged Slugs is good for Reinhardt/Zarya comps, Codebreaker is great against Orisa, etc.

**Zarya**

- I found Containment Shield to be handy for saving allies that go too deep. Barrier Benefits and Pre-Workout do wonders for your sustain, and Volskaya Vortex is good if you're constantly fighting at long ranges.
- You want to be reducing your bubble cooldowns as much as possible, so look for those perks. Weapon power perks are more effective only if you're constantly at high energy, so maybe focus on survivability early on.
- Reinforced Titanium (15% less ability damage while you have shields) is fantastic for Zarya since you effectively always have 15% damage reduction due to her massive amount of shields.

Hopefully these tips can help someone here out in getting through their problem heroes for the challenge!"
Drone-Centric Hero Concept,Overwatch,0,1kd0tq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kd0tq9/dronecentric_hero_concept/,2,2025-05-02 15:22:11,"So, I have always wanted drones in the game. I can't tell you why but it's always been a fun idea to me so now finally I've made it.

For this post I want feedback on the ideas themselves and if it would be too much, too little, or worst of all, too boring.


So first health and passives. Also he is an omnic so yippie more Omnic heroes.

UAV(the hero as of now) will have 250 base health and his passives will consist of the DPS passive and a passive called Lift.

His Lift passive allows him to fly upward with a drone and this let's him gain high ground. Think Sigma's levitate perk but better.


Now for his primary and secondary fires.

UAV's primary is called Nanite Drones. He'll shoot small drones out of his finger that will explode when making contact with enemies but won't do AOE damage. They'll be about as fast as a Hanzo Storm Arrow maybe a little slower. He'll have about 15 ammo for his primary fire, one being consumed per shot.

UAV's secondary is called Nanite Cluster. UAV will shoot out about 5 small drones that when one explodes, they all explode and these do do small AOE damage. Each burst of Nanites will cost 5 ammo.


Next up is his abilities.

UAV's ability one is called Tracking Drone. He'll throw a drone onto an enemy that will then do 1 of 2 things.
A. It will make the target's footstep glow.
B. In cases like Moira, a trail will be left behind to give the general direction she went while in fade.
This Tracking Drone will last for about 3 seconds and the enemy affected will have the revealed status the whole time.

UAV's ability two is called Locator Drone. He'll throw this drone out and it'll shoot straight up into the sky box. If UAV presses the ability again then his POV will switch to the drone and he can use it like a camera.

The drone cannot move but it's camera can and enemies are pingable through it, these enemies will be revealed for a moment.

UAV cannot move while in the POV of this drone, think Junkrat Riptire. If it's destroyed it'll take a moment before UAV can move and see from his body again. Unlike Riptire, if UAV dies he will instantly lose POV of his drone but the drone will stay until destroyed or replaced.


Finally his ultimate.

UAV's ultimate is called Nanite Swarm. He'll open up a Holomap of the around around him and can select an area on it. He can either place two dots or a hold and swipe with his camera stick. Once it's placed a much of floating Nanites Drones will spawn, if they are trigger they will explode in a wave in the direction that the player swiped or placed the dots.

To visualize better think of Brimstone from Valorant and how places smokes, then the rest should be easier to visualize.


Currently I have no perks for UAV as he's in his first draft of conception, so please give any feedback that you think would help.

Still keep feedback respectful please."
Stadium build page?,Overwatch,0,1kd0n5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kd0n5b/stadium_build_page/,4,2025-05-02 15:13:54,"Hi,

I know that there is https://www.overwatch2builds.com/. But isn't there any better alternative? I might be spoilt by pages like maxroll.gg where builds are presented in detail and information is given that Blizzard was too lazy to spill e.g. I don't know whether weapon power or ability power increase Mercy's healing in general.

There are some nagging points [https://www.overwatch2builds.com/:](https://www.overwatch2builds.com/:)

\- is the information current? It beats me to find ""Heartbeat Sensor"" perk for example

\- there is no change log

\- it is not covering all heroes e.g. Mei is missing

\- while it covers the order of powers, it does not cover the priority of perks for each cash regime and fallbacks

\- there is no discussion of builds and their counters. I was for example going for a firestrike Reinhardt only to see Orisa laugh in my face with a deflect power.

[stadiumbuilds.io](http://stadiumbuilds.io) was suggested by u/DependentEvening2195 \- thanks for that:

Pro:

\- lots of choices with likes

\- development with more cash after each round

Contra:

\- no description at all besides the name

\- also no dating or change log

\- no basic sanity checks e.g. 2 powers for round 7 - really?

Page is an improvement over the first choice, but it might at least put labels for each build to see which category is emphasized e.g. damage, survivability etc.. Maybe there is a webpage like [maxroll.gg](http://maxroll.gg) out there with some curator for each build?"
Quickplay matchmaking is broken,Overwatch,2,1kcqzpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kcqzpg/quickplay_matchmaking_is_broken/,10,2025-05-02 05:03:45,"Hear me out when I say; Quickplay matchmaking is simply broken...at least today, as I only started experiencing issue today.   
Be me, shitty casual player honestly, bronze tank, low silver anything else...imagine my surprise when I boot up Overwatch today, hop into a quickplay game and get absolutely DECIMATED by a team full of diamond and plat players...twice.

Not once, but TWICE did I enter 2 different games, in 2 different casual gamemodes, and get put against diamond/plat players.  How did I know?  I checked their profile because I went,  ""Wow...I'm getting my ass kicked!  Like really badly!""  I've NEVER had this issue before with getting matched against Plat/diamond players in quickplay.

I understand quickplay is not ranked, so there's no real way to fix this, but I think there is actually a way to fix this.  But it really takes all the fun out of the game when you're getting just absolutely decimated every game because the matchmaking made the enemy team lucky by giving them a plat/diamond player."

Overwatch 2 Lore and Story progression,Overwatch,0,1kc6qxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kc6qxh/overwatch_2_lore_and_story_progression/,4,2025-05-01 13:48:28,"Hi. I suppose it's my first post here. Also, English isn't my native language, so there may be some errors.

The new season begins with a lot of game updates - new activities, hero, BP, etc, new mythic skin also looks amazing. But, recently, I've seen a new article, ""The Art and Style of Dokiwatch"" and the one phrase caught my attention. ""Narratively, Dokiwatch is also a chance to temporarily escape the more serious angles of the game’s ongoing story""

What ongoing story are you talking about? The big last story and lore update was with the release of (as you called it) ""PvE Campaign"" \[lol\]. 

We haven't had any lore or story updates after those events. A few short stories, released on the website recently, were released much earlier in the book that came out a few months near the release of pve missions and show the same events from different angles of the world or points of view without going any further. 

I know that the biggest story campaign in history ever made was a failure (I don't even know why). But you stopped revealing the story at all. Even Overwatch 1 was better, it frequently gives us some new parts of lore. New short comics, stories, CINEMATICS, books. Even releasing a new hero gives us new parts, which can be found in the phrases, lore-based skins with story descriptions. Currently, new heroes don't even have many skins, and ones that are coming with new seasons are just fanfics (as themes of seasons at all). The only description we get is just the note that those skins can be bought in the store. We haven't gotten any new maps for a long ago, and even those we get don't have any new lore parts. Do you remember as we analyzed the history of the place from the things laid out on the map? There is nothing like this in the new maps. I was looking at them with every new release, but the last of them are just maps without even a glimpse of lore. I don't even say anything about the Archives event that gives us at least 1 new mission a year and a bunch of new lore skins and details. Those free updates weren't a failure, but 3 paid missions are - in the new client that was remade for easier PvE development, according to your interview, OK.

You have so many ways to continue the story without PvE, you don't use even the ways you already had in OW1. The fun point, even Concord was better in revealing the story. Many of you know that game only as a failure (at it really was), but it had one concept that the Overwatch team could learn. In the game, it was called Galactic Guide - by playing games, players can unlock places, stories on the global database. Every week, there was a new short cutscene that revealed a new week's theme. Daily and weekly quests also had themed descriptions, in such a way it slowly but regularly represents characters, world, and ongoing events. But the game itself was really bad, so it just didn't reach any serious story points.

You can use this method, you can use BP to reveal the story, as you already tried on Questwatch. I remember, in 2023 roadmap was some ""Lore codex"" that wasn't released either. Some old multiplayer games as Bioshock 2 or Assassin's Creed Revelations multiplayer mode, had lore notes and cinematics that unlocked according to the reached player levels. But you do nothing at all, and say that you are tired of a serious ongoing story?

You know, I'm not a fan of PvP. The reason I play this game is the fun gameplay (how characters are playing; how cool it was to dream about full-experienced pve modes, I even closed last BP only by playing those 3 missions we get), and ""17 years since Blizzard opened the door to a new adventure ... to a new world""

I'm really ashamed that OW2, which was announced as a lore and story explosion, leads us to this state. As a player not interested in PvP, it reminds me of last years of Heroes of the Storm, where only skins and heroes were the only updates, and in the end, the game's support was closed. I still have hope that we will get a happy turn of events, that's why I decided to write a post on the forum, in hopes that maybe some devs will read it and will know that there are players who still want to continue their journey into this interesting world.

But...

  
**Why does 76 have like multiple perks that give him auto aim. Auto aim rocket, auto aim after firing a rocket, extra auto aim during auto aim ult**

Like... idc if I'm low elo or just bad, but come on man. Playing dps in this gamemode is like pulling teeth. I can see why the queues for it are so quick compared to support and tank, which is insane to me. 

But just... soldier. It's so lame to play against and so boring to play as. Like if I wanted to have auto-aim all game I'd just get cheats.

Edit: Okay let me just clear up some things because some of yall have no sense.

1. I think his ult is fine. I've always been okay with Soldier's ult. Cause I know how long it lasted, and you could hear when it gets activated. 

What isn't okay, is him getting it every 5 seconds on his rocket cooldown. Auto-aim rocket+auto-aim ult every 5 seconds isn't fun. So like am I supposed to stay behind cover the entire game? Because that's literally how it is. There's no indication of him getting it, no voice line, only the sound of his rocket, which can get lost amongst the noise. 

2. Yes, I know Juno is just as bad, I've replied to many comments agreeing with that as well. It can be pretty annoying to deal with. Same with Cassidy.

3. Not every character is ""broken,"" like some of you are suggesting. I personally feel like a good amount of them are pretty underpowered. I rarely see Dva in any of my games, 

4. Overwatch released a new game mode and made it ranked only. Does that mean casual players aren't allowed to play it? Or have fun and enjoy it? I haven't touched ranked once since I've owned the game at launch in 2016. 

All players deserve to have fun, even the lower rank players! And if Soldier's auto-aim build (a build that apparently isn't even strong in higher ranks apparently), then what is the harm of nerfing it???? 

Why play my favorite hero like Ashe when a soldier/cass can just auto-aim and kill me within a fraction of a second? I'll admit, I'm not the best at aiming, plus I have good days and bad days. I'm sure plenty of other people do as well. Why is someone using an auto-aim build being rewarded (in lower ranks) more than someone who is actually trying to aim?

Please be forreal y'all, if you weren't that good at a game and some guy was playing a character who auto-aimed every 5 seconds, I very much believe that you would get frustrated, too.

Not responding to any replies anymore. I just wanted to clear up some things that people were assuming about me. "

Aqua is obviously already covering Water, so I wanted to make a hero who focused on Earth. Basically, an Earth Bender, but trying to tie it to science. So, think Poison Ivy vibes, in terms of how the hero got his powers.

***I also didn't even think about balance, tbh, so don't look at this as a balanced hero. It's literally just the idea I'm worried about. I'm also aware Venture exists, but Venture's more rock themed, whilst earth is a lot more diverse than just rocks.*** 

New Tank Hero: Gaia

General:

* Health: 100/500, in the ratio of H:A
* Movement Speed: 5.5m/s

Passive: Seismic Sense

Gaia is one with nature, and can feel disturbances through the earth beneath his feet. Whilst grounded, all enemies who are Stealthed or are behind cover are revealed to Gaia, when they are within 12m of him.

Weapon: Oak Father’s Staff

Gaia swings a heavy stave across his body, dealing damage to all enemies in range. Dealing damage charges the staff with energy, creating up to 3 ammo for his Secondary Fire.

* Range: 12m
* Damage: 70
* Attack Speed: 1/second
* Max Charge: 75
* Charge Gain (Per Swing): 15

Secondary Fire: Tectonic Canon

Gaia roots himself, scoping in and taking reduced damage whilst aiming the perfect shot with his staff, before firing a blast of energy at an enemy. When fired with a Charge from his Primary Fire, this shot ignores Armour, whilst Slowing the enemy and increasing the damage they take from all sources. Kills with Tectonic Canon heal Gaia.

* Ammo: 1
* Fire Rate: 1 every 1.2 seconds
* Cooldown: 3 seconds
* Max Charge: 3
* Damage (No Charge): 60
* Damage (Charge): 120
* Headshot Multiplier: 2.5x
* Slow: 35%
* Damage Boost: 15%
* Duration (Debuff): 3 seconds
* Damage Mitigation (Gaia): 25%
* Heal on Kill: 100
* Fall Off: 50-70m

Ability 1: Stone Bulwark

Gaia stomps the ground, creating a wall of solid rock in front of him, blocking all incoming damage. Gaia can reactivate Stone Bulwark to condense the wall into a large boulder, before launching it forward, dealing damage and knocking back enemies hit.

* Cast Time: 0.4 seconds
* Wall Heath: 650
* Wall Duration: 6 seconds
* Damage (Boulder): 60
* Knockback: 14m/s
* Cooldown: 12 seconds

Ability 2: Monolith

Gaia erects a stationary monolith from the earth that creates an AOE around it. Enemies take damage over time and are Slowed whilst inside the AOE, whilst Gaia and his allies take reduced damage and are healed over time. The Monolith can be destroyed by Stone Bulwark - Doing so Roots all enemies in it’s AOE for 1 second.

* AOE: 10m
* Damage: 15/second
* Slow: 20%
* Healing: 10 HP/s
* Damage Mitigation: 15%
* Monolith Health: 250
* Cooldown: 10 seconds

Ultimate Ability: Gaian Wrath

Gaia leaps forward before slamming the ground, creating vines that surge through the ground towards all enemies in his line of sight. When the vines reach the target, they are Rooted and Hindered, and sprout a growth from part of their body. Shooting the growth deals Critical Weapon Damage to the target. Gaian Wrath needs line of sight of an enemy to be cast, but will chase targeted enemies so long as they’re in range, disrespecting line of sight and walls.

Whilst at least one enemy target is Rooted by Gaian Wrath, Gaia has unlimited Charge for Tectonic Canon and it can be fired at will. Tectonic Canon shots will now also pierce allies and grants Overhealth to all allies hit.

* Ultimate Cost: 3,000
* Cast Time: 1 second
* Damage (Vines): 10
* Root Duration: 4 seconds
* Hindered Duration: 4 seconds
* Healing: +80 Overhealth
* Overhealth Duration: 6 seconds

Perks:

Minor Perks:

* Landslide:

Gaia gains 10% increased Movement Speed when any of his constructs are active

* Hunter’s Mark

Tectonic Canon’s Charged Shots now Root enemies for 0.5 seconds, instead of Slowing them, but it loses 1 max Charge

Major Perks:

* Walking Fortress

Whilst Gaia has any of his constructs active, he is Immune to being Displaced (Pulled, Knocked Back, Lifted, Knocked Up); Stone Bulwark and Monolith’s Cooldowns are increased by 2 seconds

* Nature’s Bastion

Whenever an ally takes damage when within 10m of Gaia, that damage is reduced by 15% and is transferred to him, taking the damage in their stead. When any of his constructs are active, Gaia now recovers 15 HP/s. If the redirected damage would kill Gaia, it doesn’t get transferred."
Stadium is Great; Hero Ban is Insufferable and Stupid,Overwatch,0,1kayg8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kayg8u/stadium_is_great_hero_ban_is_insufferable_and/,29,2025-04-29 22:44:53,"I've stopped playing Competitive. I'm only playing Stadium. 

Stadium involves incredibly engaging decisions on how to build up your character to add value to your team. With multiple build options that can be changed between rounds, the Stadium experience is dynamic, exciting, and fun. My teammates seem much more engaged in the game and far less inclined towards being toxic to each other.

On the other hand, the introduction of hero bans to Competitive have made the game mode slower, less dynamic, and less fun.

My experience with bans has resulted in complete disinterest. I don't indicate a preferred hero because I can be flexible, and because I don't want my team to toxically troll me. I don't care who is banned because I've learned to adapt my playstyle or swap to play around counters, so I have either just copied what the team wants to placate them, or I have checked off ""ready"" immediately to signal to my team that I'm comfortable with anything and that I just want to get on with the game. 

My perception of the implications of the hero ban system is that: 1) Players are denied the ability to play characters they want to play, which is likely to lead to more toxicity, leaving, and throwing. 2) Counter-play options are reduced, enabling one-tricks to remove a nuisance rather than learning how to play the game around counters. 3) There is added wait-time before the game starts that feels empty, pointless, and boring.

I also don't understand the direction which seems to run counter to everything else Overwatch is doing. It stands in stark contrast to the Stadium mode that provides so many build options, and to the recent introduction of perks.

Help me understand, dear Overwatch Community of Reddit, what is the theoretical or perceived value added to the Overwatch experience? Do other players enjoy banning heroes? Why? How has this improved your gameplay experience?"
Stadium desperately needs solo queue as a mode that rewards teamwork so much.,Overwatch,1,1kaxgqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kaxgqb/stadium_desperately_needs_solo_queue_as_a_mode/,4,2025-04-29 22:03:40,"Blizzard themselves says Stadium rewards teamwork even more than regular OW with build synergies etc:

>While good teamwork is important in all areas of Overwatch 2, Stadium is best played when you can plan and test strategies that complement your teammates. **With an entirely separate ranked ladder that is more about winning games than showing who is best of the best individually, Stadium is all about teamwork.**

This obviously means that Solo players playing with and against stacks makes for even worse games than they do in standard, but instead of trying to adress the solo player experience Blizzard managed to make it even worse in Stadium by removing narrow vs. wide groups:

>We want those of you that group up with friends to be able to play together regardless of the League each is ranked in, so there won’t be grouping restrictions, **nor will you be separated by Narrow or Wide groups.**

Which means that you as a solo player can end up in a Stadium game with players ranging from Bronze to GM in skill due to no fault of your own, but just because some stacks thought that would be fun for them and now you have to fill a spot in their game. This is something that Narrow vs. Wide groups made far less egregious.

Anyway:

1. There should be a solo queue in regular OW as well but the situation is far worse in Stadium.
2. The real reason for this change in Stadium is because Blizzard is terrified of high queue times ever since the end of OW.
3. For that reason I doubt it will happen (and since Blizzard loves coddling stacks) but let me dream here ok."

[Tank Hero Concept]: Lupa,Overwatch,65,1katqak,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1katqak,9,2025-04-29 19:29:27,"I haven’t done one of these in like a year, so I thought it’d be fun. Please let me know what you think!

Lupa is supposed to be based on hero 45 who they’ve been teasing since that dev-doodle of a girl with a sword and recently with that poster of a gladiator named “Lupa” seen on the new Arena Victoriae map. I thought the concept of a female gladiator with a wolf theme was really interesting and I wanted to take a stab at how I’d make a kit based off of that.

To be honest, tank is my least played role so I definitely struggled with creating her kit. Reinhardt is currently the only melee tank, but he’s much more of a brawler. I wanted Lupa to be more of a dive tank that really focused on coordinated attacks. 

Here’s a more detailed description of her kit.
 
**Gameplay** 

Role: Tank
HP: 350 Health, 150 Armor

Primary Fire: Spatha
- Slash out with a hardlight sword in rapid 3-burst swings
- 100 DPS, roughly 33 damage per slash, 0.5s recovery time before each 3-burst swing

Secondary Fire: Absorptive Barrier
- Hold to project a medium-sized personal shield that fills an “Absorbed Damage” meter
- 400 HP
- The “Absorbed Damage” meter resets upon the shield being broken or after Counter Attack is used

Ability One: Counter Attack
- While using Absorptive Barrier, shoot a fast-moving projectile that deals 50% of the damage absorbed by Absorptive Barrier
- 7-second cooldown

Ability Two: Energy Net
- Hurl a net that sticks to both enemies and the environment for 0.75 seconds
- Upon hitting an enemy, that enemy is rooted for 0.75 seconds
- Pressing the ability button twice causes Lupa to pull herself to the net. 
- 15-meter max range
- 10-second cooldown

Ability Three: Bloodsport
- Target an enemy to receive 30% extra damage from all sources for 5 seconds. The enemy is highlighted for your allies during the duration of the ability. 
- 8-second cooldown. 

Ultimate: Romulus and Remus
- Call forth 2 mechanical wolves that charge towards the nearest enemy, attacking them for 100 damage (50 damage each) and knocking them backwards. 
- Your wolves will then target the next closest enemy with the lowest % HP to do the same.
- Lasts for 8 seconds or until the wolves are destroyed
- Each wolf has 250 HP, and they have separate HP pools 
- Moves at 10 m/s

**Perks**

Minor Perk 1: Feeding the Pack
- You and your allies receive 15% life steal from the target of Blood Sport

Minor Perk 2: Fan Favorite
- Receive 50% more healing from all sources when below 35% HP

Major Perk 1: Venatio
- Romulus and Remus now root enemies instead of knocking them back, but no longer do damage and move 30 % slower

Major Perk 2: Aegis Burst
- Counter Attack is now released in a conical attack with a 10-meter radius, dealing 100% of Absorbed Damage to an enemy within 1 meter, and decreasing until an enemy is 5-10 meters away and is hit for the usual 50% Absorbed Damage

That’s it! I appreciate any feedback; what’s cool, what’s boring, what’s good, what’s bad, etc. 

I couldn’t really find a great illustration that matched what I had in my mind, but you get the general vibe. The gladiator was drawn by “Pureboy” on pixiv and the robot dog was drawn by Robert Chew. "

I have ADHD and Stadium is by far the best experience I’ve had playing Overwatch,Overwatch,0,1kalai7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kalai7/i_have_adhd_and_stadium_is_by_far_the_best/,5,2025-04-29 13:10:26,"Disclaimer: this is obviously just my experience but I thought it might be interesting to neurodivergent folks feeling something similar or folks curious what the hell this has to do with anything.

Overwatch is the only multiplayer FPS I’ve played since the early 2000s and otherwise I prefer roguelike games and TCGs (specially MTG, usually limited formats). I love gaming experiences that are time-boxed to 30ish minutes or less that give me decent control over my experience.

Mechanically, my aim is buttcheeks and my game sense is ok but I can often get lost in the sauce and if things aren’t going well I’ll spiral into decision fatigue swapping. I’ve managed to crawl my way to mid Silver in all roles with turret/projectile heroes and could probably grind to Gold at the point but at this point it feels like walking through deep mud.

After a week of playing Stadium and loving it I’ve thought of some reasons why it appeals to me specifically in the context of my ADHD:

* Novelty! ADHD brains tend to be novelty seeking so the build system scratches that itch. This will only get better as they add more characters.
* No Swapping! My pattern matching brain always wants to find the perfect swap or adjustment if things are going sideways but there’s way too much choice and diminishing returns in character swapping, especially now with potentially being behind on perks in the late game. Locking me into a character focuses all of my choice into the builds themselves which as I mentioned is my sweet spot. I’ve been able to contribute to reverse sweeps simply by locking into a solid build in the third round (assuming no leavers 😔)
* Aim! This may sound crazy, but I strongly prefer 3rd person view because I have more information but also because having my big ol body in the middle of the screen helps me line up my shots like having a ruler on a piece of paper. Beyond that, I can compensate for my mechanical shortcomings with specific builds (I’m looking at you, Soldier Rocket Build!)
* Learning! With the exceptions of aggressive stomps or matches with leavers I find the losses satisfying because there’s always something to learn from the decisions I made rather than lamenting my lack of pure skill.
* Silliness! The main reason I’ve stuck with Overwatch over the years and not explored too much else really is the characters and overall vibe, and seeing flying Reins, rolling Mei’s, and comical Lucio boops really just adds a layer that’s appealing to me.

There’s probably more but I thought I’d share in case it resonates with anyone. Now we wait for Zen so maybe I can actually win some Support games."
The Overwatch 2 community isn't ready for hero bans,Overwatch,0,1kajv2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kajv2q/the_overwatch_2_community_isnt_ready_for_hero_bans/,58,2025-04-29 11:34:47,"I've played League of Legends as long as I've played Overwatch, I started both around the same time back when Overwatch first launched. In LoL, in Draft Pick (normal queue) and Ranked (which will always include champ bans), you select who you want to play, and you choose another champion to ban. If I pick, for say, Lux... The others on my team will not ban Lux, even if they normally would. 

If someone does do so, they'll be roasted by the rest of the team and be made into a fool because - why? Why ban someone your own team member is good with and showed interest in playing?

I went into OW comp matches since the update, the same way I would League, choosing who I was going to play, banning whoever I wanted that didn't match anyone my team members showed interest in playing. Many times now, though, I had people select to ban my chosen hero - especially for DPS. I've also seen people ban the Support's choice(s) a lot.

The Overwatch 2 community is just not mature enough for hero bans and it's sad. I'll probably go into comp without choosing a preferred hero now - even if who I want to play does end up getting banned, at least it's not out of people trolling. :/ "

3 Things I think stadium could use,Overwatch,4,1kajluv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kajluv/3_things_i_think_stadium_could_use/,2,2025-04-29 11:15:42,"My first suggestion is a saved loadout tab. Like the example builds, another tab where you could set your own custom-builds. This would make it good to jump into practice range, and save some custom-builds for multiplayer. 

  
My 2nd suggestion is allow Hero swapping at the start of each round. I understand why there is no mid-game switching, since it would lead people to spend ages in changing their build. Overwatch has a lot of hard counters, especially with tanks. At the start of the wave during the armoury period, there is no issue with players being able to switch characters. Then just give them all their money back to reload with. 



Voting to surrender. If you get 5 votes, then the game should end, counting as a loss. Giving the other team to win. If a full team isn't enjoying a game, they shouldn't be forced to continue playing for several more rounds. Voting should become available after completing 1 – 2 rounds. If no one is having fun, this will lead to players under performing due to lower morale. If your team isn't trying then you are then fighting an uphill battle, making the game less enjoyable. Stadium is a long game mode, so being forced to deal with this for an extended period can be quite frustrating.

Late Game Zarya Build,Overwatch,2,1kaicq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kaicq0/late_game_zarya_build/,1,2025-04-29 09:41:28,"So I've been goofing around with Zarya lately in Stadium and a straight damage build goes HARD late game. Has anyone else tried this? This build really starts to take off after the 3rd round, though. It feels like a, ""trust the process"" type build. I just got out of a game where we reverse swept, and this is after my teammates were calling me AI and trash. I'm willing to lose the first few rounds if that means we get to the 7th with a full build online.

I'll try to explain my build as best as possible. Not having a talent calculator blows. All of the perks will be found in the ""Weapon"" category, aside from Round 1.

Round 1: Weapon - 5% extra damage, extra ammo. Ability - 10% extra ability power. 1st Power perk - I snag the one that gives 150 energy.

Round 2: Hopefully you have enough for the blue 15% damage perk. Depending on how well your first round went. R2 I'll drop the extra ability damage perk for extra cash. But always focus on as much damage as you can, and maybe sprinkle in some extra ammo if you have some funds and no other damage perk options.

Round 3: This is where it starts to come online. I always shoot for the Eye of the Spider purple perk here. I'll sell off any non damage perks to get it *or* grab the perk where you can't go below 20 energy and maybe one of the cheaper purple damage perks. Shoot for a higher damage % if possible, and I tend to ignore the secondary buffs for most of em. They arent bad, but I really just want the damage.

For the 2nd Power perk, I'll get the one that makes the bubbles bigger.

Round 4: Great job, you've just melted their entire backline 5 times and are now rich af with a huge bounty on your head. Get Eye of the Spider if you dont already have it. This is where I shoot for at least having Eye of the Spider (purple perk), the blue 15% extra damage perk, and either the perk where my energy doesnt drop below 20, *or* the increased range. If its a choice between the two, take the increased range. Continue stacking damage perks, and if you have space, ammo.

Round 5: MORE DAMAGE PERKS. At this point you should be pretty much fleshed out. If you can afford it, grab the purple perk that gives you 20% extra damage and something about crits doing more damage. The secondary perk for this is useless here. Ideally you should be around 75% or so extra damage. For the 3rd Power I'll get the piercing beam one or the perk where you get 25% faster ult charge, but the ult doesnt last as long.

Round 6: More. Damage. Perks. As many as you can. Shoot for the highest % you can get, ignore the secondaries. Although, one worth mentioning might be the Armor ignore. I can't say for sure if it actually works with beams, but if they have an Orisa then I tend to get it.

Round 7: If you've made it this far, don't lose hope. You should be fully stacked with purples, all damage. At this point it should be easy to get to 100% extra damage, and it all falls on your shoulders. For the last Power perk, I'll get the other option I didn't get from round 5. Either the pierce beam or the 25 faster ult. I'm still playing around with this one, though.

As far as gameplay is concerned, I play Zarya with a pretty strict ""solo"" mentality. The bubbles are mainly there for me. If I'm in comms with my buds I'll maybe spare them if they have ult or something, or are going for a rez. But 95% of the time I'll use my bubbles and play aggressive.

I'll generally start to walk with a bubble to get charge, then break off into cover. If a squishy is within range, they'll normally melt or use a bunch of CDs, but I try to always have one bubble on reserve for escaping or backing up. When you're in attack mode, a 115-150 charged Zarya with 20% beam range, and extra damage when the enemy hits 30% HP (Eye of the Spider), is a very scary thing to see. They're just gone within a few seconds.

I also normally walk past the enemy tank and into their backline. If I'm in a stack and my supports and DPS walk with me, their backline is dead in seconds. Then we just clean up the tank at that point. This obviously doesn't work if you're in solo and your teammates don't walk with you, so your results may vary. But overall, Zarya is a real easy carry char, and if you manage your bubbles and energy correctly, you'll be able to kill any squishy before they can even react.

My friends and I have been trying out a Zarya, Mei, Reaper or Cass, Juno, Lucio build and it's been working wonders so far. We pretty much always have some sort of speed to get onto their backline, and having the Mei walls that slow + her Cryoboulder is insane. Topping it off with Juno's Ability Power build and Cass Fan the Hammer build + my Zarya damage build, nothing stays alive.

Good luck! Stadium got me interested in OW again after a solid 6-7 months of hating it."
Support Main Learns New Roles,Overwatch,5,1kah7bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kah7bm/support_main_learns_new_roles/,2,2025-04-29 08:19:29,"I have been a support main for a looooong time. I started playing after launch in 2016 and mainly played DPS, but eventually switched to support because nobody was playing that role. Put 2,000 hours in the game, 1,000 hours in support, and 500 on Ana alone. Nearly hit GM as Ana in OW1 and only hit Masters as a Support in OW2. Stayed like this till around mid last year.

Started trying out DPS again. Had so much fun actually playing my old DPS characters I used to like and trying out new ones. Remembered my days as a Mei main, whipped out my Symmetra knowledge from years of watching Stevoo, and swept the dust off of my third most played character. Widowmaker at 100 hours, I had a shitty PC at the time so I gave up on being a Widow main due to my computers poor performance.

This experience also gave me a perspective on how DPS players perceive a match. Felt more mad at my supports for not healing me, even though I've been in the spot of the support before. Then as a support it helped me realize how I can play with my DPS better and how much more I can do damage on support.

Now, the April Fools mode had me tried a role I have only put 200hrs into. Tank. Had to play some games as tank to get all the rewards. Fell in love with playing Orisa, the only tank I ever really put time into before. She was good against infinite loop Rein and I felt like I could take over the team fight.

Then I tried more tanks like D.VA, Ramattra, and Sigma because I had that learning mindset turned on of ""they look cool, I want to try them"". In the past I would only think ""I'm gonna suck at them"" and just sticked to what I knew.

6v6 quick play has me flexing like I did back during launch of Overwatch. I played what the team needed a lot. Which is how I got stuck on support. But luckily now I've got a trio who can let me play what I want without me worrying about roles not getting filled.

This all leads to the new Stadium mode. I was complaining about playing support in Stadium and feeling frustrated by most of my tank players to my boyfriend. They just said ""you should tank then"". It was like damn, yeah I should.

Since I had been in a rut playing support, my tank friend was tired of tanking, and my other friend was only choosing support. I decided to take over tank, my tank friend took DPS, and then we had my friend on healing.

Holy shit its so fun to play tank. I main Orisa and I love harassing people as her. Once I got on her, I went on a winstreak (3-0 everygame) with my friends. We got to 5 games before we all decided to head to bed but we're gonna get back to it tomorrow.

Just felt like sharing my experience. This game got a less irritating and less repetitive once I branched out. I found forgotten skills I had as a flex player and I fell in love with a role I refused to play for years. Also made me realizing playing tank wasn't as awful as I thought it was going to be along with I'm not terrible at DPS."
Gambit like Gamemode for Overwatch 2? Thoughts?,Overwatch,20,1kah392,https://i.redd.it/zkjzwt3ttpxe1.jpeg,8,2025-04-29 08:11:40,"Not sure if many of you are familar with the Destiny 2 Gamemode ""Gambit"", but I feel like if would be a good fit in OW. Its pretty much PvPvE and requires you to collect points by killing enemy bots throughout the match and those points let you spawn in more enemy bots onto the other teams side. Once you reach a certain amount of points, a big boss spawns in and you have to kill it to win. They could use the scrapped enemys they had for PvE originally. Could be used as a Junkenstein Halloween gamemode? Maybe? Sorry if this doesnt make sense but it came to me while I was high."
Overwatch 2 Is a Social FPS — Let’s Give the Social Side Some Love,Overwatch,0,1kaao2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kaao2b/overwatch_2_is_a_social_fps_lets_give_the_social/,17,2025-04-29 02:10:19,"Overwatch 2 nailed the ""FPS"" part. Now it’s time to show some love to the ""social"" part. In an interview, the director once said Overwatch 2 was meant to be a ""social shooter.""  
While they've made huge improvements in gameplay, polish, events, and overall feel — the *social* aspect still feels underdeveloped compared to what it could be.

Here are a few ideas that could really help:

* **Allow us to spectate friends' Competitive matches.** We can spectate Quickplay, but not Comp — why? Being able to spectate your friends' high-stakes games would keep people connected even if they aren’t always in a 5-stack.
* **Allow us to queue for games while spectating.** Sometimes your friend is deep into a match and you’re just sitting in menus. Letting players queue for their own game while spectating keeps everyone engaged and social.
* **Allow us to spectate high-MMR lobbies.** Other games like Dota 2 allow you to spectate top-tier matches through the client with minimal delay. You can even filter by specific heroes. Imagine being able to watch a Top 500 player play your favorite heroes live through the Overwatch client. Not only would it be insanely educational, it would keep the game feeling alive at all times.
* **Expand the ""Recently Played With"" functionality.** Right now you can see a list of names from past matches, but you can't click on them, view profiles, or easily add/message them unless you caught them in the match. Let us click on names from the past 20–30 matches to view profiles, send invites, or add friends. It's small, but it would make a huge difference for networking.
* **Create a social ""hangout"" hub.** Small, fast-loading maps where players can meet up, chat, practice aim, or just hang out between matches. It doesn't have to be fancy — but it would make the downtime between games way less isolating, especially for solo players. I know there are custom games for this, but I think a hub option in the 'while you're waiting' would fit perfectly.
* **Bring back the party finder.** Bring back the ""Party Finder"" where players can post and join groups based on basic filters: role preference, mic/no mic, chill/serious, qp/comp/stadium etc. Imagine hopping into Comp and quickly finding a 2-stack that needs a DPS — without needing Discord servers or outside apps. 

As someone who's Masters, it honestly feels a little isolating sometimes - even Quickplay has hidden MMR. I don’t meet a lot of new players naturally anymore.  
Even just being able to spectate friends’ matches would make a *huge* difference in making Overwatch 2 feel like a true ""social FPS"" again.

I’m really hopeful that modes like Stadium are the beginning of more social improvements across the game.

What other social features would you want to see added? Would love to hear everyone’s ideas - maybe we can help push it higher on Blizzard’s radar."

My Feelings On Stadium So Far,Overwatch,1,1k9xvt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k9xvt6/my_feelings_on_stadium_so_far/,7,2025-04-28 17:09:20,"Stadium is great fun, I'm really enjoying it. Short satisfying games with a greater goal, fun upgrades etc. I've played a fair few games now, and played Overwatch a lot in the past.

However, there are a few things I'm kinda hoping for going forward:

1. I really do want to see it be 6v6. This is my main one. I know people will say queue times will be bad, but I do have some arguments I'd like to make. 
   * From my experience, queue times have been short and if anything Tank queue times are slightly longer (<2min vs <1min). It's not much, but I've seen their queue time be longest on a few occassions.
   * I think tanks are one of the most interesting and flexible classes to build. You can go more tanky, more damage, and some do offer some interesting support powers and items too. This (I think) leads to the tank being more tempting to more players, so less queue issues.
   * No hero switching is rough when you choose a tank that happens to be countered by theirs. We can't swap heroes any more, and ""Choosing a tank that can't be countered as easily"" is not a good solution. Having 2 tanks would help mitigate this quite significantly.
2. More items that help heroes counter opponents. They are the things that players need to use to help them counter the enemy. For example, I worry what may happen when we get heroes like Pharah and no hitscan, we may start to need some abilities that help you deal with this more effectively as we can't change heroes. An example might be ""when you deal ability damage to a hero, ground them so they cannot jump or fly for X seconds. The item that helps you do more damage to shields is a great example of a good one.
   * Taking a kinda similar game like Deadlock is perhaps a good example. Heroes in that game have different abilities, but are more homogeneous and can be built many ways allowing them to adjust more to counter the enemy. In Overwatch, characters are often very different from the get-go and even in stadium can't be changed so drastically (e.g. DPS -> Tank). Due to this, some characters are just more harshly countered by others, and we maybe need more ways to adjust this.
3. Balancing and more heroes. These two are a given, and we know they'll do it, I just want to add it cause I'm excited for it. Torbjorn, I'm looking at you. This also includes maybe tuning down the damage in some areas, or increasing the ability to make yourself tanky. I know they maybe want to avoid endless fights, that is a risk. However, taking an item to minorly buff your health rarely feels worth it and will not prevent you from getting killed extremely fast by a soldier with damage boost and damage items etc.

Please do comment with your thoughts and feels on this. As I say, the main one is that I'd love to see 6v6."

[Tool] Stadium Mode Build Tracker for Overwatch 2 (Free Google Sheets Tool),Overwatch,1,1k9eymd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k9eymd/tool_stadium_mode_build_tracker_for_overwatch_2/,1,2025-04-27 23:25:56,"Hey everyone!

I’ve been really enjoying Stadium in Overwatch, but I've felt like it's a pain to remember some of my favorite builds. I also didnt like having to go to the training room every time I wanted to review powers, items, etc.

SO, I decided to build a **free, dynamic Google Sheets tool** that helps theorycraft builds ahead of time and gives you quick reference in-between rounds!

# What It Does:

* Lets you create and reference builds ahead of time
* Lets you **select a Heroes** and **Builds** dynamically based on what you've created
* Auto-fills the **recommended Powers**, **Items**, **Round Costs**, and **Strategy Notes** for each round
* Makes switching between different builds **fast and easy mid-match**
* Comes with some automation under the hood using Google Apps Script, but **no setup needed** — just copy and use!

**To get started, open up the link and to the ""START HERE"" tab and follow the instructions from there!** (You’ll need to make your own copy to use it!)

Link to the Sheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bFRGgCvxxkp4bvSktbaQ5opFZ2ytBHLZ0EM9B2uZvck/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bFRGgCvxxkp4bvSktbaQ5opFZ2ytBHLZ0EM9B2uZvck/edit?usp=sharing)

# Final Thoughts:

If you find it helpful, feel free to tweak it, add your own builds, and share your fave builds (just screenshot your ""Guide"" tab)!

And if you have ideas for improvements (or run into any issues), I’d love to hear feedback. I’m planning to keep refining it if there’s interest and updating it with every patch to make sure everything is up to date.

Good luck out there and have fun theorycrafting!"
VERY LONG Stadium queue times,Overwatch,3,1k9cmbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k9cmbq/very_long_stadium_queue_times/,7,2025-04-27 21:44:48,"Firstly, I LOVE stadium, its so fun and a breath of fresh air the game needed (ever since Overwatch ""2"" released lol, probably even earlier when the game was left on life support).

Super high ping when playing Overwatch since the Season 16 update,Overwatch,14,1k970qs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k970qs/super_high_ping_when_playing_overwatch_since_the/,27,2025-04-27 17:47:06,"I've been having hours of horrible ping when playing OW since the latest update. Most of the times I'm being placed in the ams1 server, and usually I've been on a steady 70-90 ping. I just played a game on 400. My internet is fine, I have 600 download and 160 upload + I've had a long call with my ISP and we tried everything. Also, it's just Overwatch. Everything else internet-wise works perfect.

It's not all of the time though, last night I played on 100 ping, which is still higher that what it was but it was ok. But right not it's unplayable and I don't know what to do. I've had this issue before (different city, house, PC and ISP) and got 0 helpful response from Blizzard's tech support, so I'm turning to the masses. Anyone experiencing something similar?

Things I've already tried:

1. Turning the router off and on (+ waiting about 30-60 seconds while it's off)
2. Switching between my 2.4Ghz WiFi and my 5.Ghz one (I'm usually on the 5). Also, I've been playing Overwatch for 3 years on WiFi, more than a year in my current house and ISP it's been perfect, so don't say I have to connect it to the router (I can't and it's not the issue).
3. Switching the frequency channels of both the 2.4Ghz WiFi and the 5 one.

I wanted to try a traceroute but I can't find the ams1 IPs anywhere online (I remember Blizzard had posted them before but I can't find it anymore). Any help? Thanks in advance.

EDIT: I've been playing on and off for the past 24 hours and I can report a potential fix. You need to change your preferred and alternative DNS in both IPv4 and IPv6. Provided [here ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/ip-addresses/)are the values I inserted and I've been playing on 70-100 ping with them. Be sure that if you regularly do `ipconfig /release & ipconfig /renew`, be sure to assign the DNS again."

My Perspective on Perspective (as a console player),Overwatch,3,1k8ioyv,https://i.redd.it/rbmu3r12v7xe1.jpeg,6,2025-04-26 19:44:33,"So right off the bat I'd like to say that Stadium is the most fun I've had playing Overwatch in years. I have put into this game more than 1500 hours, and this style of gameplay speaks to me perhaps more than anything that has come out in Overwatch 2 so far.

But for the purposes of this post, I'm not talking about the powers, or the upgrades, or the 7 short rounds, as much as I genuinely enjoy all those aspects.

Instead, I have something to say about the third person perspective that many of you are going to absolutely hate me for... I love it. And my experience in the base game would be improved tenfold if it were an option there.

PUT DOWN the pitchforks and torches, hear me out on this one, this is why I think it's important that I highlighted my being a console player in the title, because I fully believe *that* is the crux of the disconnect in opinion here between me and the general Overwatch playerbase. You guys love your first person perspective, a lot of people seem downright vitriolic over the idea of having this as an option over it in normal comp, but allow me to impart onto those PC players in the audience a little secret about the first person perspective on console...

It SUCKS BALLS.

With no FOV slider since launch, and slower flicks and 180° spins (even while playing consistently with the best settings a hcpeful video can buy), there's little better way I could describe console Overwatch other than it feeling... Clumsy. Half-blind. This is bad enough simply for the experience of aiming and looking at things, when characters like Lucio are added to the equation it becomes a fucking travesty, wall-riding feels abysmal in console first person. Now, for me? Third person fixes all of these things. My Hitscan aim feels smoother, I can both flank and *respond* to flankers easier, I have less tunnel vision, and by god I get to *enjoy* the crazy Collab skins I paid an exuberant price for (Transformers, MHA and Avatar dropping so close together was brutal.)

I understand the advantages that it has over first person that people see as unfair, I understand that first person on PC feels better, and that that's the primary audience to consider here, but I need to level with you as someone who was not enjoying Overwatch for a long time until Stadium dropped: third person would improve the base game *dramatically* for me. From a position of pure self interest, this shit feels *better*, by a large margin.

Now at the end of the day, would a first person FOV slider for console be a valid compromise? Probably... But at this point, I don't think it would shift my experience of normal comp the way that the third person perspective would. It's not often that I find myself with a deeply unpopular opinion for Overwatch's future, and I'm bummed as hell that I won't be getting this shit in base comp any time soon."
Stadium General Tips/Reinhardt Tips & Builds,Overwatch,9,1k8azcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k8azcu/stadium_general_tipsreinhardt_tips_builds/,6,2025-04-26 13:40:16,"I was making some notes on Reinhardt's perks, and learned some things that apply to all heroes. So with that in mind, here are some things that aren't immediately obvious followed by some tips for Rein specifically.

Blizzard, if you're reading this, please give us 5,500 starting cash so we can make impactful and diverse choices in the first round.
______________________
""Overhealth to Allies"" - This includes you.

I've not tested exhaustively but several abilities with this wording also affect the user, and it presumably applies for other effects with similar wording.

Ogundimu Reduction Field/Nebula Conduit

Taking that 15% damage over 3s from Nebula Conduit continually tops up your 0.5%*20 damage resistance from OGF. The lower the damage received, the fewer ticks you get, but this effectively means the perk applies to burst/blast as well as sustain damage. This dynamic seems to apply with other abilities that accrue on attacks and hopefully isn't a bug that gets 'patched'.

Siphon Gloves

This refers only to *Quick* Melee damage, and doesn't apply to non-quick-melee attacks - Unlike the Epic perk 'Gloomgauntlet', which states 'Melee' damage but refers to all melee damage, including Rein's Hammer.

Weapon/Ability/Survival Crossover (and Cooldown stacks)

If you're getting comfortable with the amount of perks available, then you might have realised there's a bit of crossover in terms of what you find where. For example, each type's Rare tier has one '-5% Cooldown' perk while each Epic tier has a '-10% Cooldown' which you can stack. If you want to be absurd, you can pick the 3 Epics just mentioned for -30%, the Rare Ability 'Multi-Tool' for another -10%, Epic Survival 'Vanadium Injection' for the -10% on Ult, and a random -5% for a total of 55% cooldown reduction when in Ult state, 45% regular.

Moving onto tips exclusive to the hammerzeit man:
_____________________
Powers:
_____________________
Smashing/Feel The Burn

When you inflict 'Burn' on an enemy, 'Smashing' tops up with each tic of burn damage, taking only one swing of a 'Burned' hammer to get to full. NB: Your hammer glows blue when FTB is active, and it appears to hold this state indefinitely.

Impact Burst

The 20% damage explosion affects the target, as well as those in the radius - so this is also a 20% damage bonus to your firestrike (vs the first target struck).

Wilhelmwagen

30% movement speed bonus means you move faster than your regular walking speed. This may not be immediately obvious if you're not concentrating.

Blazing Blitz/Magma Strike

Yes, firestrikes created by swinging your rocket hammer after ulting are able to proc Magma Strike, and every other strike will do so for solid damage. Note, your default attack speed gets 4 firestrikes in 4 seconds. Unfortunately, even with 60% attack speed you still only get a single additional firestrike for a maximum of 5 allowing you to get off 3 before your target can move. 70% attack speed allows for 6 firestrikes though, and even with ~80% attack rate bonus from Rein's Epic perk 'Plan Z' at low health that's all you get.
_____________________
Builds - I'm not listing all the perks/items for these as it's very contextual on who you're fighting with/against.
_____________________
Fortress

Powers:Wilhelmwagen/To Me, My Friends/Smashing/Feel The Burn (Optionally: switch either of the last two with Vanguard, Shield Stampede, Amplification Barrier)

Something like 80HP/S healing when you have shield up, plus healing 15% of damage shielded with some variations for damage resistance based on what you expect to be tanking. It's nice, and you'll sometimes have the most healing in the team in the late game. If you go for 'Shield Stampede', you have the additional pleasure of being able to charge down Ana without fear, and with your damage barrier it's possible for an alert team to focus fire if you catch a tank. Note that when playing this build, you should be face-tanking more to allow your shield downtime. Use the perk 'Overclocked Barrier' if you're working with Amplification Barrier or want to risk having a bigger shield. Out of his Epic Survival items, 'Infusion Generator' adding 100% of your life to shield is alright and works well with 'Amplification Barrier' as you can just walk opponents down in front of the right team, but 'Phoenix Protocol' reducing regen time is a lot more flexible and sustainable when you're playing dynamically. Getting 'Biolight Overflow' means you'll recover almost instantly from being countercharged, giving you time to shatter a prone Rein before they can recover if needed.
Firestriker

Powers:Impact Burst/Magma Strike (Consider 'Vroom Boom Boom' due to the synergy with Ability damage, provided you're not facing Orisa who doesn't approve of being charged)

Do you want 130% ability damage with an extra 20% firestrike damage to the tune of 250 damage a strike, and would you like a pocket Mercy boosting that by another ~100% for around 500 damage per firestrike? It only costs 60,000 and 2 powers :) that's the 5 highest ability+ epic perks, with 'Nano Cola' from the Rare tier topping it out. However this is also quite overspecialised and losing 5% here and there allows for a lot more options, and could better put into Cooldown (if you're committing) or survivability. You might want the extra radius and sweet animation change from 'Chimera Maw', but it's a little less raw power.

Leroy 

Powers: Vroom Boom Boom/Vanguard

If you choose these powers, in addition to the Cooldown perks in the first section for 45% base Cooldown, you can Charge (Cancel Immediately)/Swing/Firestrike/Firestrike then repeat with no gap. With 'Shield Stampede' and 'To Me My Friends', plus the 'Martian Mender' perk (3% life regen/s *and* -10% cooldown), you actually have some semblnce of survivability. Also consider the Epic Weapon item 'Dampener Grip' for 1s reduced cooldown on weapon hit. You could feasibly chain charges with a single meaty swing between, but that would be disturbed.

Flight (Gryphon Glider)

Not a build perse, more of an ideology. I don't know if this is anything other than a meme pick - It's difficult to control, though by binding crouch to a thumb button on the mouse you may find it easier to move in 3 dimensions at once.  Also note that when activating Charge whilst moving on the ground, you'll keep your momentum in this direction during the animation instead of planting on the ground before ascending to the heavens. It's also faster to go up than come down, fortunately I suppose. An alternative that...is also a bit of a meme strat is to pick 'Rocket Boots' (Survival, Epic) and jump, then charge at the apex.

______________________________
That's it for now.

If you notice anything I should add or any mistakes, let me know and I'll correct them. I think everything here is a reflection of the current state of things though. Some of this is based on opinion, and may be subjective."
Question for Kiriko mains,Overwatch,1,1k8adyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k8adyd/question_for_kiriko_mains/,6,2025-04-26 13:03:16,"

What perks do you like, especially the minor/first ones?
I play a lot of Kiriko — she's basically my main — and I can honestly see arguments for all of them.
So far, about 80% of the time, I take Fortunate Teller (the one where hitting an enemy sends 2 healing ofuda to a nearby ally). It just finds value so much more consistently. It's super satisfying to land headshots and see those little floaters shoot off to heal someone, sometimes even someone completely out of my field of view.

The only time I really take Urgent Care (50% increase in ofuda speed) is if I'm basically the clutch/main healer — like if I'm paired with a Lucio, for example. If I have a solid second support, I don't see much value in it. Kiriko's healing usually keeps up just fine, and the 50% boost still gets bottlenecked by her hand reload animation (not a real reload, but you know, after every six ofuda she pulls her hand back, and this isn't sped up).

As for her second perk, obviously the fun one is Shuffling (2 blinks), but lately I've been picking Foxtrot (movement speed boost after Suzu) way more, especially against comps with Tracer, Sombra, or Genji.
Honestly, I found I rarely used the double blinks effectively — not just blinking around for fun. The two times I actually made good use of it were:

1. Coming back from spawn — blink to someone closer, then blink again to where I actually want to be.


2. A clutch save — blinking into a dangerous spot, throwing Suzu, then blinking out and hoping for the best.



Other than that, it usually just sits there, unused.
Just curious what other Kiriko mains think — what perks are working best for you guys?"

Is Freya Fun But Flawed?,Overwatch,0,1k868g1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k868g1/is_freya_fun_but_flawed/,14,2025-04-26 08:12:02,"Been playing a lot of Freya in Overwatch 2 lately, finding her super fun. Great mobility, satisfying gunplay (reminds me of Soldier’s simplicity), and I find the auto-bow concept cool. She borrows bits from heroes I love, and her kit feels smooth and rewarding.

That said, she just doesn’t hit like other DPS. Even when I’m landing shots and playing smart, it feels like her impact is limited compared to picks like Sojourn, Ashe, or even Cassidy. She’s fun and skillful, but ultimately feels like a D-tier hero just outclassed. I think she’s close, though. Some small tweaks or changes to perks could go a long way.

I'm not sure what exactly to change without making her too much like other heroes.

Possibly a perk around adding knock back to the explosion of precision arrow.
Or even adding knock back/wall pin to the precision arrow, like predator skewering you to a wall 

But again those ideas are just mods of other heroes abilities.


Curious if others feel the same. Is it just me, or does she need that little something to be viable in comp?"

My takes on Stadium,Overwatch,5,1k8447e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k8447e/my_takes_on_stadium/,10,2025-04-26 05:59:17,"I found this mode by far the best one they ever created since launch, basically. It is innovative, interesting, challenging and tactical. But I think it needs some small improvements.
On my first games I got quite confused by the UI works (only figured there was a roster of other perks on my second or third game). On how the powerups worked, took some tries and deductive reasoning for me to figure how things worked (but no rocket science). I think they should put some information of how things work like what ""ability based perks"" affect characters, if supports get benefits from boosting weapon damage and things like that.
On not been able to swap heros, not gonna lie, the I find it a little bad in some occasions (but overall a good thing).
Most of my matches were fair on that regard, but on a few cases that shot in the dark was a absolute miss. In one match I had a genji player that had to go against zarya, mei and moira. The poor guy did his best to fight against them and luckily in the end we won, but it was hard as hell.
I belive a good system to deal with it should be a limited voted swap. Let's say this genji player wanted to change or we asked him to, so he would put a request, all or most of us should vote to allow to and so he could do it. That swap could be limited to let us say 2 times for the whole game per team.

I have ranked to Gold 1, enjoyed playing support and making a duo with my wife on Moira. 

BUT… omg, latest season is something. Tried Stadium and feeling incredible unbalanced - a soldier and Cassidy in enemy team shreds you down. Watched the game replay - Cas has 11 rounds and just right clicks everything in sight, lol. Mercy on ulti can’t save the team, Juno without a strong build has little impact, my team fades in seconds when I see DPS producing tons of damage without us able to mitigate that. 

Tried playing regular 5v5 competitive - the wait time is about 7 minutes. Two games in a row - having leavers. And then wait again… Of course, everyone is on Stadium. 

Bottom line - Stadium is not fun, sups having hard times. Competitive is not fun, waiting times on Gold is just insane.

1, some minor things to improve the practice range for stadium, we really need ways to force De-mech, or build an enemy bot to test against.

2, in depth tool tips. A tool tip should give me exact numbers, on how my things are effected not just '10 ad' or '20 ap'. I get what it allegedly effects, but HOW does it effect that? For example tell me exactly what 5AD does to my bullets or healing beam or Moira suck etc.

3, gonna get this out of the way, CASUAL STADIUM. Plain and simple.

4, Build planners/recommend items. Other Mobas let you plan your build, we should be able to do it here, and for the new players pull a page out of League's book and have a page that adapts recommendations to what you're playing against, like recommend Volskaya ordanance against a super tank, or weapon jammer against soldier, or El-sa'ka suppressor against Mercy. Go even further and recommend things like the nano on demech for DVA if she's getting demeched a lot, so on and so forth. Adaptive recommendations for people that don't build plan.

5-Merge some perks for characters like Ashe who just take too long to come online with things like her AP build or make some of said perks items so they have a chance to compete with characters like Soldier.

6- You should be allowed to swap perks. I get the idea of having something locked in, but you already locked them into their hero, they should be allowed to swap perks if it just isn't working for them.

7- Increase rewards and improve the match history tab for Stadium.

8- Make flanks harder and have less cover, right now EVERYONE is suddenly a flank because of how small the maps are and it'd be nice if some of the best flank angles were less rewarding and more routes to high ground for Ana for example.

9- More unique items that are fun and expand the characters build options."

I posted earlier saying it did nothing for non weapon but it seems to just be non-scaling for torpedo(unless someone can explain otherwise)

Without the power, torpedo deals ~80 damage to the two training bots and cooldown is 11s, 
with the perk it reduces it by about 1.5sx2 or 3s bringing it to 8s

With the perk and 130% ability it should deal about 195x2 damage and reduce cooldown by a bit less than 8s(2 enemies, ~200 damage = ~4s reduction each)
But it still only reduces it to 8s.

Note: perk only works if you are far enough away for the cooldown to start(about .5s after release), otherwise it does nothing.

Interestingly weapon boost does scale the damage tracked and decrease cooldowns."

When I’m in the main menu and when I’m selecting my character at the start of a round, everything looks perfect and how it should be, then it just goes bad during the match, I tried messing with some of the settings and it’s already set to resolution which is the default, I just don’t know that much about why this could be happening, I tried looking stuff up to no avail so I figured I’d redownload Reddit and ask around, also the settings on console have way less stuff than pc overwatch so like when I looked info up it was showing settings I didn’t have, basically I’m just asking if anyone knows how to fix this?

I fat-fingered some typos in the title... sorry)

Been playing since the release of OW1, and I can't help but feel that this is what OW was always meant to be.

Is it perfect? Of course not, it was just released, tweaks will be expected. But HOT DAMN is it fun! Imagine when the entire cast is eventually ported in!

It's just so refreshing and fun to create ""builds"" for your character. You also get to play more games modes more often, and the modes are abridged, which makes games like PUSH actually feel extremely fun. Push is easily my favorite game mode in STADIUM. 

I even see dynamics where you have players develop a mid-late game build that starts weak but ends up strong after 2 rounds. This is just such an interesting and fresh dynamic for Overwatch to adopt.

So here goes
3 things I like:

*  Major build diversity
* Push feels incredible in its shortened form
* (I thought that I wouldn't like it, but I was wrong) 3rd Person POV

3 things I'd like to see changed

* the rest of the roster!
* being able to start editing your builds during the very long intermission after round-end. Why do I have to wait an extra 30 seconds or whatever it is till I can start making my changes.
* (as many others have stated) a vote-to-surrender feature. There is no need to wait through a bunch of matches if 4/5 of the team is ready to call it"
Stadium D.va Bomb Build,Overwatch,1,1k7ob99,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k7ob99/stadium_dva_bomb_build/,3,2025-04-25 17:51:00,"Stadium has to be the most fun I've had in Overwatch in some time and wanted to share a fun [D.va](http://D.va) build I've been using, so far I've won about 7 of the 10 matches I've played with this build, 2 of them being against Zarya. 

# Powers

1st: Express Detonation (Always catches people off guard)   
2nd: Party Protector  
3rd: Ultra Wide Matrix   
4th: Toki Slam (By late game this is just fun to farm ult) 

# Ideal Items 

Green: Winning Attitude   
Blue: Junker Whatchamajig, Dae's Detenator, Solo Spec  
Purple: Pulse Planting, Nano Cola Nitro

In between round you can supplement the choices with more armor to help you survive. Nano cola nitro and Solo Spec should be at bottom priority unless you are really struggling to survive. 

# Playstyle

The whole point of this build is to farm ult as quickly as you can and whenever you de-mech you always start off with 25% ult and when you re-mech you gain an additional 15% ult charge because of winning attitude. For some reason it seems to treat getting mech back as reviving which helps you build ult quickly.

Outside of that you're just playing D.va like you're supposed to, dive in and out, use defense matrix to build your ult, and if you lose mech then just focus on getting mech back as fast as possible but if you die it benefits you either way. This build mostly begins to take off by round 2/3 and if you're able to build into Pulse Planting early that's going to help you build ult faster as the enemy team gets stronger. Nano Cola Nitro 

  
Would love to hear what folks think or if they have any D.va builds they've had fun with! "

So, I've been playing overwatch for maybe 3 or 4 seasons now, as my first real shooter game of any kind.

It's been fine so far, some wins and some losses, but in the past hour I've gotten not one but two teams of what I think are bots (reported and avoided both times). As in, a full 4 stack of players who don't pick or ban anything, basic banners and icons, no skins, no pings or reaction to anything, walking into walls and getting stuck in spawn... Both enemy teams noticed instantly, but there's not much to be done about it and I lost rank for both games. It's really disheartening that I've basically gone down almost a whole rank because of it and I can't do anything about it.

First people said yes, they're bots, but the second team said no, there aren't any bots and they're just deranking/throwing on purpose. So basically, what I'd like to know is are they actually bots? They absolutely weren't moving or acting like a person at all. And how common is this? For reference, I'm only silver 2, so I'm sure it happens much less frequently the higher rank you are."

For example, commanders clip will overwrite this buff so that you won't receive the +3 ammo, you'll just get +1... unless you cancel the reload animation with a flashbang? in that case you get +2 ammo.

Here's the worst part. When you throw a second flashbang, that ammo you just gained gets taken away lol. Hot potato is a worthless power and can actively be harmful in a lot of builds (the reason why ammo is good aside from the obvious is because full house increases your damage by 1% per ammo available)

Restricting hero swapping was the worst decision they could have made for Stadium.,Overwatch,0,1k6uxm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k6uxm9/restricting_hero_swapping_was_the_worst_decision/,13,2025-04-24 17:22:49,"You're picking a hero blindly not knowing you may be up against a direct counter, or even multiple. And then you're stuck for the next 20-30 minutes getting absolutely rolled when there's no shot you've got a chance with your current team's setup from the moment you walked out of spawn.

The entire game of Overwatch is built around heroes countering eachother. Picking the right hero for the right situation and team comp is crucial. This includes the enemy comp. In Stadium, if your team spawns in with a mei and a reaper and the enemy's got an ashe and a Cassidy the game is basically over from round one. If your tank is a zarya and the enemy's is a D.va you already know you need not worry about the D.va for the rest of the game because you got a direct counter.

Solution for this can be very easy:

* Penalize swapping. Make people lose all or most of their money when they swap heroes. This way people can still swap in round 1 and be at a slight disadvantage of missing perks instead of being directly countered for the next 4 rounds.
* Prevent swapping AFTER round 2 or 3. Players should have worked it out by then that their composition doesn't work.
* Restrict swapping to once per round. Maybe even once per game.

Alternatively: Add a forfeit button that the whole team votes on. Majority vote and its an instant loss. I've seen multiple players just give up during the second or third round and start playing damage ana or getting toxic in chat because they have to spend at least another 15-20 minutes getting rolled."

In reality it is the least fun thing from overwatch I have seen in a while

  
My biggest complaint is that its a competitive game mode....WHAT WERE THEY THINKING WITH THAT?

  
Stadium is a brand new game mode that plays nothing like base overwatch, at all. Even the 3rd person Camera changes how you play the game let alone the dozens of perks and items you can choose. And they made it comp only? On day one?????

This game already has a severe snowball effect and I ain't talking about Mei busted ass cyrofreeze. Good teams get more resources to buy more abilities to become even stronger than the enemy team. This game should be in the arcade 

  
But it being comp brings other issues such as leavers as in when someone leaves the game there is a timer that counts down till you can leave without punishment. Except it doesn't work in this Game mode and you won't be able to join another game until yours officially ends. The game is already lost, just let me move onto the next one, don't make me sit and twiddle my thumbs for 5 minutes waiting for nothing to happen

  
Then there is the issue of balancing. Especially when it comes to which characters is chosen, Zarya counters 3 of the 5 tanks available and reinhardt isn't really a hard counter to zarya. Meanwhile junker is countered by 3 of the 5 tanks

Stadium has some serious flaws and I think we need to talk about them,Overwatch,3,1k6quov,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k6quov/stadium_has_some_serious_flaws_and_i_think_we/,18,2025-04-24 14:23:28,"**Preamble**: this is not a thread regarding whether you are having fun or not in this mode. I think Stadium is fun, chaotic fun, and Overwatch needed it, but a fun mode can also be flawed.

Basically: Stadium is a MOBA-lite mode, but it fails at most things this mode should excel.  
There are some flaws Blizzard needs to address either to improve UX and the gameplay loop in general.

**SHOP**

*^(Edit: as someone said in the comments, this could not work in Stadium because in Overwatch the downtime between death and respawn is very limited and rounds are more fast paced than other MOBAs. Other than this, locking the ability to purchase items prevents counter-sell/counter-buy mid round, so yeah, I'll leave it here but this point is not very important. I still think that the ability to access it, even without the ability to purchase anything, would be useful to an extent, but this is a personal opinion.)*

You should be able to access the shop at any time at the spawn, only for the green/blue/purple items, not for the major ones (which I'm fine they are only purchasable only at certain rounds).

This could create a better flow during the shopping phase because you can pick an item or sell one and have some time to read through all of them while you're respawning, allowing the user to not be overwhelmed because of the amount of info they has to put together.

**ITEMS**

Items should be sequential and not ""unorganized"" as they are now.

Yes, there are categories such as ""survivability"", but every green item does something different from every blue item etc.  
In League of Legends you have a skill tree similar system in which you pick a starting item and can evolve it to another one following a path. If you know what to pick, you can directly choose the ending item (e.g. a blue or a purple one) without going through the paths, but having a clear ""direction"" in what an item can evolve into would be a huge improvement and would improve UX so much, making the item selection easier.

**LOADOUTS**

You should be able to create loadouts exactly as the ""suggestions"" tab, but customized as you please. So you can create an already done build without the need of searching through \~100 items and without the need to remember where that specific item is located.

This, combined with the item evolution system discussed before, would improve the shopping phase.

e.g.: I create a build with 4 major powers and 6 purple items.  
When I click on the purple item, it shows me the path that starts from the green item associated and end to the purple item I have chosen.  
Of course you're not locked into the chosen loadout, but it can be a good starting point.

**STATS AND ITEMS FILTERS**

If you select a stat, you should be able to see all the items related to that stat, so you can ""filter"" them and know which items you want to buy more efficiently.

So, as an example, if I need more reload speed, I should be able to select that stat and see all the items that gives me reload speed, without the need to scroll every item hoping to find exactly what I need in the midst of \~100 other items.

**ITEM DESCRIPTIONS**

Items descriptions need to be worded better, in order to improve the ease to understand what that item does. This is more complicated but I'll try to give an example:

>""At the start of the round and on the first regeneration, it grants 20% movement speed for 10 seconds out of combat.""

This could be worded as:

>""When you respawn:  
\+20% movement speed for 10 seconds out of combat  
\[2 uses, refreshes every round\]""

Maybe also using different colors, for example blue for ""respawn"" (mechanic), yellow for ""movement speed"" (stat), green for ""10 seconds"" (duration) and red for the number of uses left.

***

This is just what came to my mind from the \~15 games I played. Of course I could be wrong to some extent, but I really think Stadium needs some tweaks in these fields.

I'm curious to know what you think about it, what you would like to see other than what I've just wrote OR what you think it's wrong with my suggestions and how you would improve them.

Hoping we can create a good discussion so we can give constructive feedbacks to improve this mode.

Clearly they stopped doing free legendaries but this leaves us with

* Lifeweaver
* Iliari
* Venture
* Juno
* Hazard
* Freja

having zero lore skins. I like when the seasons have a theme with cool twists on the characters, but having none skins that are story based is terrible. That is why I loved the Archives Events, the skins in the early seasons were really some of my favourites. I still use the Overwatch commander Morrison. And we know most of the new heroes have their origin/lore looks designed. We are still missing Vishkar Lifeweaver, we could get trainee Iliari, war-weteran/soldier Hazard or search and rescue Freja. Even for the older heroes we could still have some nice additional lore skins added so why not make it into a season? 

Well probably the answer is: because of PvE. Or the lack of it and the dumpstered story missions. Creating a season based on lore would bring up the questions about it and reopen the wound of cancelled campaign. But if they can't give us a whole lore based season, maybe sprinkle some lore skins in the battlepasses, like they did with Red-shirt Mauga. At least give me something with what I can believe that this world still has some lore, some mysteries, some backstory to it and not just constant elseworld/crossover episode junk (disclaimer: I do love me some collabs as well and cool themes, I just wish it was all a bit more balanced).   
Btw who do you think should get a lore-based mythic? Maybe Echo or Ramattra? Some hero where they could go bonkers with the design but still find a way to explain it in-universe?

I have tried writing a ticket on different browsers, incognito, I've reset my password and enabled 2FA, verified my email and everything else. Nothing has worked and I'm still unable to submit a ticket about my locked account.

If I have had my account locked I would like to at least know the reason. I would suspect that it's from disconnecting from so many games (I only quick play) due to connection issues. 

If anyone has also had this issue, specifically the support ticket not submitting, I would really appreciate any solutions you might have used to fix the issue. Thanks. "

Did Blizzard fire any people who have any construction in their thoughts because the mode is not well crafted, and some of the worst balance the game has ever seen. Play it for 20 seconds and you can see. The team needs smarter designers or just people to play the games before launch.

  
Stadium is an unbalanced, unfun mess because of 4 heroes. 

Perks are unbalanced and unfun because some are worthless, and some give an instant kill potential. 

April Fools was not played by anyone before launch, and it shows that mode was the least fun and disengaging gamemode I have seen in my Overwatch time.

  
They need QA testers to play the game, even for 5 minutes, and 90% of these issues are gone in an instant."

I have been playing Overwatch (2) for years with the same provider and I never had any issues with latency. I would usually get my latency displayed as being between 20 ms and 30 ms. When the DDOS attacks hit the Blizzard servers recently, I was hit as well. The thing is that I have been affected for most of last evening and this evening by a huge lag with everything from 250 ms to a full second, making the game unbearable to play. But this lag seems to only hit me and none of the other players. Restarting my computer worked last night, but this evening it has not worked. My network connection is fine according to two different speed test pages - 210 MBit/s download, 48 kbit/s upload and a ping of 9 ms and a latency of 27 ms - 37 ms. So everything is fine. Also, when I play Diablo 4, I have a latency displayed of 40 ms, which is still fine.

Stadium is hype but I have some thoughts.,Overwatch,5,1k66cyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k66cyr/stadium_is_hype_but_i_have_some_thoughts/,4,2025-04-23 20:21:54,"So first and foremost 'I was overwhelmed by all the augments' is not really a valid complaint, they put in a practice range for stadium specifically. Please use it before jumping into stadium, same with any MOBA really.

Now onto the real things.  
Primarily I just want to say Stadium is awesome. It's some of the most fun I've had in overwatch in years. Sure there are some combos that feel really strong, and sure it probably needs a balance, but overall its like a more refined Junkensteins Overwatch MOBA and that's awesome.

Some issues though 1, people leave a lot. Like a lot a lot. And once one person leaves more people tend to leave to not get stuck in a more challenging/lost game. Hopefully this will be addressed, I get sometimes people DC, but the people on the team shouldn't be punished for it so much.

2, with how tight some maps are flanking is incredibly oppressive with some mobile characters becoming even more mobile than before (Lucio, Soldier, Reaper for example). We don't really have super good options to help the backline rapidly like Winston or Brig so I hope those two are a priority.

Third rewards for Stadium (hero mastery and general payoff for playing a match) are basically nonexistent which sucks and hopefully will be addressed. It's terrible to be in a game thirty minutes and get like 1 tier and only time played '800' on a hero. It's a competitive mode, let me earn proper hero mastery too please.

Another big takeaway is people who know how to play MOBAs often spec better (or I'd assume that's why they're specing better) and so there can be a lot of anti-heal and not many cleanses available, so a few more options to help there would be nice.

  
Side thoughts and hopes:  
\-Really hope for a regular not-season gated release schedule for heroes. I am fine with big changes like maps coming on a new season, but frankly since a lot of this will be porting, bringing in a character or two in the middle of a season is fine and a great way to keep things fresh.  
\-I hope some useless items are removed from certain characters shops (Reinhardt Ammo options for example), they're bait that a normal MOBA would just disallow that character from getting.  
\-Specific tooltips; what I mean by this is if I buy AP on say Soldier, give me the examples of what that will do for my damage/healing values. Normal MOBAs have things calls Base Damage and then Ratios, if it scales with AP tell me what that does EXACTLY not just that 'it effects Helix Rocket and Biotic Field'.  
\-Completely fresh modes/map objectives to spice things up and make it more unique.

  
Overall though I really like Stadium, and I'm thankful this was released, good job devs. Keep up the good work."
[Discussion] Overwatch Stadium Mode – Honest Thoughts After a Few Matches,Overwatch,8,1k6226g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k6226g/discussion_overwatch_stadium_mode_honest_thoughts/,34,2025-04-23 17:29:53,"After playing a handful of matches in Stadium Mode, I really wanted to like it — but I can’t shake the feeling that something’s just… off. It doesn’t feel polished or fun in the way core Overwatch does. Here’s a breakdown of the biggest issues I’ve found so far:

# 1. Third-Person View Feels Robotic and Unfinished

* Animations look stiff and janky.
* Reloads have an awkward \~1 second delay.
* Since most animations are designed for the first-person view, you can’t clearly tell if you’ve used an ability or not.

# 2. The Balance is a Mess

* You either stomp or get stomped.
* A 5-stack premade vs. 5 solo queue players isn’t remotely fair.
* That said, this kind of imbalance is also part of core Overwatch’s DNA — it just feels even worse here.

# 3. Builds Are Overwhelming and Poorly Designed

* You either use a spreadsheet to optimize your choices or you lose.
* The UI doesn’t help — no clear explanations or synergy indicators.

# 4. Third-Person View Makes Everything Feel Smaller

* Characters and environments look tiny.
* First-person is naturally more immersive and makes aiming much easier — it’s a clear advantage, especially because targets appear noticeably larger.
* The game wasn’t designed for third-person clarity and it shows.

# 5. The Commentator Is… Rough

* The voice lines are buried under heavy filters. It honestly reminds me of the commentator in Heroes of the Storm — and I disliked it there for the same reason: it’s all noise and no clarity.
* Feels like a mumbling robot adding noise, not hype.
* There **needs** to be a “mute commentator” option in settings.

# 6. The Whole Mode Feels Rushed

* From animations to build design to audio — it just doesn’t feel ready.
* I like the *idea* of Stadium Mode, but the execution is off.
* Right now, it’s not fun — and I don’t see myself coming back unless some major improvements happen.

# Conclusion

I’m curious to know what others think. Did anyone else feel like this mode was unfinished, or is it just me? I really want to see this idea succeed, but it needs serious work."

2. Some Heroes weapon that doesn't had ammo capacity, but you still can purchase from the item shop, and that was ridiculous.
3. Hero counter had no solution, and you can't even re-select heroes in Stadium mode, such as [D.VA](http://d.va/) vs Zarya, and there's no perks or item that can use matrix totally absorb beams.
4. As Support Mains, I always confused the weapon damage and ability damage which can be able to increase my heal abilities like Mercy, if not the skill boost item totally useless for Mercy skillset.
5. Four to Seven Rounds for win? Nope.

Overwatch Stadium flaws/suggestions,Overwatch,3,1k5zr91,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k5zr91/overwatch_stadium_flawssuggestions/,3,2025-04-23 15:54:20,"Hello fellow Overwatch players,

As you all probably know, overwatch launched a new game mode called Stadium. I have been looking forward to it, and I'm surely not the only one. 

I just wanted to create this post to get some obvious flaws out of the way, so let's adress the pink elephant shall we... 

1. Leavers due to game crashes or other reasons. 

I have been playing unranked for most of my time in OW, but now it seems that when someome leaves in Stadium, there is no replacement for that player. I had 2 games where my tank left (whether or not intentional) and the game was pretty much over at round 3. Blizzard please do something about this!

2. Draft pick please!

Stadium reminds me a lot of a traditional MOBA style, where players lock in their heroes and play it for the entire match. But the fact that the player does not know what the enemy team picked, makes the match kind of random. This is especially a problem, I feel like, because one team has a big chance of getting 'lucky' and picking a team comp that possibly counters the other team. 

My suggestion would be to introduce draft picks for the Stadium game mode, or at least bans like they are implenting in ranked now. I think this would give players a fairer chance and would make the experience a lot more enjoyable.

3. Surrender option.

Please introduce a surrender option Blizzard! Because of the aforementioned points, when a player disconnects or if the match just seems unwinnable, give the players a option to vote for a surrender! It seems futile to stay in a match that just feels unwinnable.

Also a note to players of Stadium, please remember that the ranks right now are mixed, meaning that high and low ranks are probably playing in the same games right now, but as the good players rank up there will hopefully be more fairer matches in the near future.

I would encourage anyone to reply to this, since Stadium is a new game mode we are essentially the pioneers, and we can maybe help make the game mode better. If Blizzard will listen to us prayge.

Alright, have fun in the game :)"

Yesterday Overwatch launched its new season and I was patching my game to play some Overwatch. My game started and it did put me in queue. Every time I’m connecting I’m getting an error which says “Phone Number already in use” but I haven’t changed anything. I literally played 2 hours before the new update. Now customer service tells me they can’t do anything if someone else chose my number. I never have received any authentication code or something. Not even a email that my phone number got removed. It is still attached to my blizzard account. 

So far I only tried removing my phone number once and adding it back again. Did not work for me. 

I’m hoping anyone could help me fix my problem. Maybe someone had the same problem.

From platinum to master in *statistics*,Overwatch,22,1k5yiiw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k5yiiw,5,2025-04-23 14:58:21,"**Greetings fellow overwatch enjoyers,**

Recently I decided to track some data from my ranked support games (I'm a kiriko/moira player). Some of the stats I tracked include current rank; date and time; maps and objectives; start side (if applicable); hero picks; game time; win/loss.

The first figure I included is an overview of my rank progression throughout the games I played and also highlighting what hero I played during these games **(1)**.

I gathered data for nearly 200 games and decided, purely out of boredom, to create some nice plots/graphics for those nerdy enough to ponder over. I know there are some sites out there that also track your data and games, however I found that these didn't really *satisfy* me. Therefore, I decided to use R studio and create my own statistics (+figures) in order to test my own hypotheses.

With this in mind, I looked into  ...

* ... if there were specific days I usually win more games **(2)**
* ... if I end up winning more games before or after 17:00 (+ evening) **(3)**
* ... if I win more games with a friend I duo with **(4)**
* ... what hero performs better across tiers **(5)**
* ... if there are certain heroes on my team/enemy team I play better with/against **(6 + 7)**
* ... what the heroes with the highest pick rates are **(8)**
* ... what the usual game time is for a specific objective type **(9)**
* ... what maps and objectives I play the most (as I felt like I only got those goddamn push maps) **(10)**
* ... if matchmaking balances out your start side (attack vs. defence) **(10)**

I think I definitely got some interesting findings and really enjoyed making my own customised plots. However, I will leave the conclusions from these data open to your own interpretation, as that's more fun ... right?

Feel free to shoot me a message with any questions/suggestions/discussion points!  


***Notes and disclaimers:***  
*- Throughout the coding process, I used DeepSeek Generative AI to assist me in more complex analyses, as I only have experience with basic R coding*  
*- I didn't perform any statistical analyses as I am not acquainted enough to choose relevant/fitting tests, combined with the fact that I don't really care about it*  
*-  These plots portray my individual Overwatch ranked experience and are subject to variability*  
*- These data were collected from 10/03/2025 to 19/04/2025 and therefore fit entirely into OW2 season 15. I think this is relevant due to the meta of that season*  
*- I made these plots for fun, please keep that in mind :)*"

i have a mild form of tourette’s syndrome and one of the things that comes with that is the fact that i cannot smoothly slide my joysticks. it’s like a sensory thing for me. i have to aggressively flick/mash them in a singular direction, and then let go and do it again (or something similar to that). i’ve been playing video games for the better part of a decade now, and shooter games for 7 years of that. i have never felt like i was good at a shooter game because of my inability to precisely aim due to my tourette’s. i’ve never felt like i contributed to a team as much as my friends/teammates who i play with. i’ve always been lesser than. and there’s absolutely 0 way to compensate for lack of aim in a game where the goal is to shoot people. until i found overwatch in 2023. playing mercy allows me to never have to aim at an enemy whatsoever, and focus more on positioning and decision making and team synergy and assisting my friends who are good at aiming. i’ve climbed to masters. i am good at video games. i am insanely intelligent and good at fast paced decisions and planning and executions of plans. i’m so unbelievably cracked at mercy it’s insane. and i’m not saying that to toot my own horn. i’m saying it because it’s true. i provide so much value as mercy. and now with this hero ban system mercy is getting banned 90+% of the time. i can no longer play mercy in comp. and there are 0 other heros on support who i can fully 100% utilize every aspect of their kit without needing to aim. and i get that people make fun of mercy mains for not being able to aim. just get better they say. but with my condition i physically cannot get better at aiming. it is not something i will ever be able to do in my lifetime. and i’ve found unbelievable amounts of joy from playing mercy and being able to finally showcase my video game skills and prove that i can be good at video games. and now it’s gone. just like that. in the snap of a finger. and if they don’t either remove the hero ban system entirely or exclude mercy from being able to be banned, i will never be able to (happily) play comp in overwatch again (without deranking to silver/gold at best). the only game mode i enjoy. the only game mode that i can showcase my immense skills on a platform where it matters. i hate quick play. it’s not even fun. i am so devastated by this. like truly hurt. and i know this sounds silly. tourette’s syndrome preventing me from playing video games. but it’s been a struggle since the beginning of my gaming career. and i finally had 2 really good years of video game experience. where i felt useful. where i felt appreciated. where i felt needed. where i felt like i was providing value to my friends and teammates, not taking it away. and im just really sad to end my chapter of overwatch like this. far too soon. far too early. and with so much left to play.

there has to be so so SO many other players out there who have some sort of disability who main mercy. she’s the most disabled inclusive character to play. and my heart goes out to all of you who share similar stories as me. there will be a game somewhere out there where you can play with friends and not have to be forced to have impeccable aim to keep up with your friends. we’ll find it. and we’ll flock to it. but it is super sad to lose this game as the outlet to be able to do that. because it was so fun. for so long.

so, goodbye overwatch. you changed my life so much over these past two years. and while the hero ban system leaves an unbelievably sour taste in my mouth, i will NEVER forget the millions of good memories i have from this game. the friends ive made. the moments ive shared. it truly was the time of my life. :)"
"Why can't ""Toggle Camera Shoulder"" in Stadium be bound to the same key as ""Perk Select""?",Overwatch,20,1k5stae,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k5stae/why_cant_toggle_camera_shoulder_in_stadium_be/,9,2025-04-23 08:54:48,"Overwatch generally allows duplicate keybinds for functions that don't conflict.

So I wonder why ""Toggle Camera Shoulder"" (under Options-Controls-Stadium) and ""Perk Select"" can't be bound to the same key. There's no perk in Stadium.

Has anyone found any documented/undocumented functionality of ""Perk Select"" in Stadium? Otherwise it'd be a perfect key (Alt by default on PC) for shoulder swap sitting there unused in Stadium."

You're a heal sink that needs to play more defensive to actually win. An off tank to spread the attention would be really nice. Stadium still has the 5v5 issue of ""someone died? Especially tank? Fight probably over. Best to retreat"" 99% of fights. 

Even worse if tank isn't great or having a bad game, especially if they are counter picked (no swapping allowed) you're stuck with them for a dragged out loss, unless it's a total stomp. In either case, not fun. 

6v6 open queue comp was genuinely the most fun I've had in overwatch 2, but I know I don't speak for everyone. I know they would probably never do 6v6 Stadium because they don't want to split the queues even more, but it's a shame they are dying on this 5v5 hill imo"

I’ve been into FPS games for 20+ years and just found OW. I know, I know, how has it taken me this long. But it’s just so dynamic, the team play, character depth, character roles, counter play, unique maps, understanding spacing, I just love it all.

I fucking hate matchmaking & getting steamrolled because of terrible queues between gold and high diamond as a high plat solo player that ends up with the worst team at times and the best at others. But that’s not why I’m posting. 

I’ve seen so much negativity about overwatch everywhere it’s been crazy. Outside sometimes shit matchmaking and toxic chat, for me, this game has been the greatest. I learned how to play, was having a blast…BAM…Perks get dropped. Loving it…BAM we get the ability to vote and ban characters, fuck off Mercy Res/Symetra turrets….then BAM next up is a game mode called Stadium where shit gets crazy. I CANT FUCKING WAIT. 

I just feel like it’s been an unreal video game experience for me over the past year or so, and  I’m loving it all. I find myself literally laughing out loud sometimes when I wall off a tank who’s trapped as Mei, or play Sombra and pester a back line, or combo a ult with Zarya and Bastion, or Diva bomb where everyone scatters like cockroaches, or Sunburn a team with Illidari who gets deleted when times perfectly as a support.

First thoughts about stadium,Overwatch,5,1k5i4p0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k5i4p0/first_thoughts_about_stadium/,17,2025-04-22 23:29:14,"So I have been playing Overwatch 2 since release and I'm someone who really likes the game in both ranked and casual play.  
The rounds today felt sadly very bad, I think this is mostly due to the fact that all skill levels play on the same rank at the start of the season. Almost every round I played there was someone on the enemie team that completely dominated the field. Either it's a Genji who walks around the map like it's his own playground or a soldier with good aim and 10k+ dmg each round.

I get that ranks need to distribute... but I have a feeling that this won't get much better. All the stupid and annoying stuff in Overwatch just got more annoying. Genji can deflect more often, he gets a blade slash even when he's not in his Ultimate, more movement speed, more health etc...

So what's the outcome? You focus Genji and the one time you get to kill him he ressurects himself because every char can get this perk... So you kill him a second time, Mercy comes in with much more health and rez the genji and automatically flys away with Valk after the rez (perk).

This mode makes stronger players even stronger and you will get dominated harder than in a normal match.

To top that all off I can't play with my teammate who plays on console, because the gamemode is only available in ranked and ranked doesn't allow crossplay.

What is your first day experience with the new mode?  
I personally have no motivation to play again tomorrow and will just wait a few days with hope it normalizes a bit."
‘Paladins is an Overwatch clone’,Overwatch,0,1k5hqzi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k5hqzi,5,2025-04-22 23:13:17,"I know it’s kind of played out at this point but this season has stolen so much from Paladins and after the recent announcement that they’re not going to add more content I’m kind of salty about this

Pic 1- The inclusion of stadium has added both the inability to change characters and an in game item shop, both of which are things paladins have had from the start. Overwatch at least has unique upgrades for each character while paladins has the same for every character, however paladins does also have unique upgrade cards that you equip as a loadout at the start of them game (sorry I don’t really know how to explain it better).

Pic 2- Paladins had a very similar ‘magical girl’ theme back in 2020 except each skin had 8 customisation options, not exactly relevant but definitely still notable considering the Juno mythic. I know magical girl isn’t a theme created by paladins and I’m sure other games have had a similar thing but too still.

Pic 3- I’ll admit this one is minor but the new soldier skin (I think there’s others too but I don’t know how to unlock them or if they’re different) has a very similar effect to the obsidian skins from Paladins.

Side note why is there another mythic aspect??? And they still cost 20 prisms??? For one recolour?????"

I'd like to check them in peace and not under pressure of the timer. Anything of sort already available?

One of her major perks is that when she hacks a target, the virus transferred to that target will also affect anyone within an 8-meter radius. If you think about it, once she has her EMP ability, if your team doesn't have a sustainable support ultimate, you could be in serious trouble. Of course, she’ll likely cause chaos in lower ranks, but I'm not sure how it will play out overall."

# Chapter 10: The Shape of a Choice

Peace is a dream.

Cause is a burden.

Survival is a necessity.

But choice is a present.

It’s the only thing she’s never let go of.

She’s seen it.

From scavengers whose hands shook from hunger.

From a mercenary who wanted to matter, if only once.

From a soldier who raised his rifle in the face of death.

She’s heard it.

From a monk who dreamed of unity.

From a warlord who fought for their kind.

From a seeker who clashed with her only to understand her.

And she never asked any of them to be different.

Because they had chosen.

She simply does not forget what they chose.

Humans.

Omnics.

It makes no difference.

She watches.

She listens.

And if you fight, she will remember how you did.

And in her silence,

in the blade she borrowed,

in the stance she learned,

in the breath she never had to take, she chooses, too.

**Because she exists.**

**Because she is free.**

# And that is where her story begins

Thank you for reading Eryth’s story.

I’ve always wanted to show what the world of Overwatch is capable of, and the kind of story just one omnic could tell, so I wrote one.

Is there anything you’d like to know more about her?

Does she feel like she belongs in the world of Overwatch?

What do you think she would look like in the game?

How would she interact with the heroes we already know and love?

I’d love to hear what you think.

And stories only live if they’re remembered.

If hers stayed with you, the choice is yours to pass it on."
If you had the ear of an overwatch dev....,Overwatch,5,1k4sswd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k4sswd/if_you_had_the_ear_of_an_overwatch_dev/,31,2025-04-22 02:09:42,"...what QOL improvement(s) would you suggest?

Im not interrested in hero buffs/nerfs (e.g. more damage, shorter cooldown, ""nerf her"", perk ideas- im sure devs are sick of those opinions lol) and more interested in general gameplay changes, game modes, UI, controls, etc. or even specific tweaks to existing abilities that would make your favorite hero more enjoyable or intuitive.

For instance...

\- everyone, not just healers, should be able to see their teammates health by the color of their silhouette. Ease our burden of communicating that we need help- most dont communicate at all, especially in the heat of a duel

\- all abilites on character info screen should include specific numbers like they do for perks and patch notes (30 more healing, burns for 50 damage over 2 seconds, etc.). If something is incresed by 20 or extended to 3 seconds, I kind of want to know what it was in the first place

\- (on my last point) More info should be given to players who want it- include a codex, stat book, or expand the hero gallery with ability specifics and tips (a la wiki). People really dig rpg elements like a codex/stat screen. The people long for knowledge. How long does it take for health to regen? or shields? barriers? how does armor work!!! damage over time and damage reduction? hit scan vs projectile vs beam? hero's effectiveness against armor?

\- should be able to preselect perks from the hero select and hero info screen each round. It's a happy medium for those who have situational perks, and the ease for people who are certain which perks they want (the case for most people, im sure)

\- everytime a healer reloads due to fully exhausting their magazine, they should have a ""reloading"" voice line

\- almost everthing available in the menu is also a button on the home screen- either declutter the home screen or ditch the menu

\- lifeweaver should have an audio cue when his weapon passivesly reloads. Ball has one! So unfair!

\- lifeweaver's blossoms should charge automatically and shouldn't use ammo when you switch weapons. They could then be fired with a button press, simplifying his controls and removing some unnecessary control options. Most importantly, it would save me from achey fingers holding- down buttons idefinetly and dancing them around to pre-charge blossoms

\- (plight of a weaver main) he's so unviable and thorns are kinda inconsequential- they should have a very weak bleed effect. If kiriko can exist as she is, make every healer a powerhouse."

"Widowmaker Needs a Rework, Not Just a Nerf or Buff",Overwatch,0,1k4glra,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k4glra/widowmaker_needs_a_rework_not_just_a_nerf_or_buff/,21,2025-04-21 17:38:18,"Hey there, quick intro about me, I’m a pretty casual Overwatch player with around 523 hours played since launch. I peaked in Diamond as a Widow one-trick, but I switch to other heroes now and then, especially when I actually want to climb. Playing only Widow just isn’t viable in Overwatch 2.

Widow just isn’t a hero you can play “decently.” You either play her perfectly or her impact is basically zero. And honestly, I hate that. I’m older now, my aim isn’t consistent every day, but I still pick her because I vibe with her playstyle.

Add to that the fact that spam is out of control right now. Kiriko is spamming shurikens and can two-tap you from across the map. Tanks just ignore you because they have so much HP and microscopic head hit boxes. Widowmaker feels like she’s in a terrible spot design wise. The game has moved on. It’s faster, more sustain-heavy, and she’s still stuck in Overwatch 1.

I get it, most of the comments will be ""fuck Widow,"" and that’s fine. But I genuinely think she needs a rework. I don’t care how it’s done, and it shouldn’t be on me to figure it out. The reality is, most of the playerbase hates her as she is now. Even when I’m having a great game with 80% accuracy and 40% crits, I know it’s not fun to play against.

We need real suggestions. Most Widow posts are either calling for a nerf or a buff depending on who picked her and how well they’re aiming that day.  
  
A proper rework would make a lot more sense. I honestly cant wait for her to be in Stadium, I believe she will be the last hero just because how will they balance her..."
Just got my first lootbox from dupes/rerolls,Overwatch,3,1k4fkzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k4fkzs/just_got_my_first_lootbox_from_dupesrerolls/,6,2025-04-21 16:57:25,"TLDR: it’s just a normal loot box nothing special 

I wasn’t clear on how receiving the lootbox from duplicate rolls would work and fortunately got to see for myself thanks to leftover credits from overwatch 1 and grinding for all the lootboxes this season. 

I had been getting dupes off commons for a while now and finally hit enough to get my first lootbox off dupes. I never saw it communicated that the lootbox rewarded off dupes would guarantee drops that you didn’t have yet, however after seeing how many dupes it took to exchange for 1 lootbox i had hoped it would be worth it and give rolls that weren’t dupes/guarantee higher rarity drops.

Unfortunately after opening the lootbox i can confirm it is a regular box. I got 1 rare and the rest were common dupes so i essentially burned a shit ton of rolls for one slightly better roll. 

I do understand that the duplicate lootbox fills out faster the higher the reroll rarity, however i still think that the current system of addressing rerolls feels extremely lack luster. Hopefully devs are still looking at how to best reward the players with lootboxes and make some adjustments to the reroll lootbox so your compensation for hitting a bunch of duplicates isnt more duplicates.

**What i learned:**

Outside of the disappointment, i think the biggest thing i learned from this is 

1. If you have grey credits, save them to buy the hero gallery epics/legendaries since they drop less frequently and on the off chance you get a duplicate it will fill your reroll lootbox more
2. ~~If you collect all of a rarity it’s better to wait till next season to open more lootboxes. New drops of that rarity should enter the pool and you can avoid burning rolls that add up to almost nothing and get you nothing special~~ 

Edit: lootboxes auto open at the end of season so the current system forces you to burn rerolls instead of allowing you full compensation of duplicate drops"
Lifeweaver rework idea,Overwatch,0,1k4cpqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k4cpqe/lifeweaver_rework_idea/,1,2025-04-21 14:50:18,"# Abilities

1. Healing Blossom(LEFT CLICK) - **charging time decreased to 0.9** from 1.45 seconds. Max heal decreased to 50 from 80. Heal per seconds(HPS) increased to 55.5 from 55.2. After getting healed by this ability, **ally can heal themselves for 100** in 1.8 seconds by dealing damage to enemy(100 damage max). You can still heal ally self-healing, but max heal ally gets by this ability can't be higher than 50 per 0.9 seconds.



2. Thorn Volley(RIGHT CLICK) - **10% cooldown reduction of abilities per 100 damage** dealt by this ability against enemy heroes.



3. Petal Platform(LSHIFT) - **40 heal per seconds, 15% rate of fire buff** on platform. **Size and health of platform increases by 25%** following number of allies on it(100% max). **Enemies get rooted for 1 second** while rising up after stepping on platform.

4. Rejuvenating Dash(SPACE) - cooldown increased to 7 seconds from 5 seconds. **Max range increased to 10m** from 6.9m. **50% damage reduction during dash**.

5. Life Grip(E) - **deals 100 damage to all enemies in the path**(between Lifeweaver and ally). **Ally can cancel the pull with interaction key** while being pulled.

https://preview.redd.it/mdyz2aoqg6we1.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=824146693f2913a048502808a9dd3505a0e474c6

6. Tree of Life(Q) - **stem part of tree gets 2 times fatter** but still usable in narrow spaces. **Tree knocks enemies away from you** once for 8m when the tree grows **with 50 instant damage**.

https://preview.redd.it/p0bc38hsg6we1.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a7caea2bf35b31e197fa39e4c0c278d5691d216

# Perks

Superbloom(minor) - number of thorns you must hit reduced to 10 from 20, damage reduced to 25 from 40

Swamp Tree(minor) - tree slows down enemy by 40%

Petal Path(major) - you can charge/use two petal platforms at the same time

Center of Pond(major) - 20 more heal per seconds and 10% more rate of fire buff on and under platform

# Ideas

My main idea was 3 points. Make his heal more stable, make him more active and leading, give certain reasons to use each of his abilities.

Now you can heal stably as charging time of his basic heal hugely reduced, ally can self heal for a while and petal platform heals allies too.

You can also play him more actively and lead the game as you have more time to use other abilities except healing and you have two more damage(grip and tree) and crowd control(petal and tree) abilities now.

Each abilities have a certain reason to use as well; his basic attack now lowers his cooldown of abilities, platform heals you, increases your fire rate and it roots enemies as well, dash allows you dive into the enemy more boldly, grip deals AoE damage in the path and tree deals damage and pushes enemies away.

I hope he will be played in dive, rush comps or to counter them.

In more details of each abilities,

* If allies and enemies are both on Petal Platform, they all go up but only enemies are rooted.
* I thought you must be able to cancel the Life Grip while you are being pulled as it has too much potential to be used in wrong ways. Unlike walls like tree, ice wall, jagged wall, it's the only ability to directly change teammate's position.
* I thought Tree of Life doesn't have its own strength at all at the moment. Heal is much lower than trans, much less value as an obstacle as the stem part is 3 times smaller than ice wall. So I added its own strength to push enemies away once with a bit of damage. I thought it fits him as he's like an anti-dive support at the moment. Also, I thought it's too bad as an obstacle so I made the stem part bigger.

Please tell me if you have any suggestions!"

# Chapter 9: The Answer in Motion

Zenyatta rose from the ground, weightless, shifting into his stance.

His hands moved like the current of a river, flowing, never rigid.

Eryth drew the scavenger’s knife.

She did not hesitate. She did not wait.

She struck first.

The blade cut through the air, fast, sharp, direct.

But Zenyatta was not there.

He did not parry.

He did not block.

He simply moved, and the blade slid past him, striking only empty space.

She fights because he has made the choice to fight her.

That was the first thing he understood.

Eryth pivoted, attacking again, a sharp upward slash.

But again, he turned with it, redirecting her force without ever touching her.

Not stopping her.

Not resisting her.

Letting her pass.

Her third strike did not come immediately.

She stood still, the knife steady in her hand, watching him.

Zenyatta had not struck back once.

She let the knife fall from her fingers.

And she drew the mercenary’s whip-blade.

A ribbon of metal, coiling, striking, extending.

She snapped it forward.

The whip-blade cracked through the air, an extension of control, of command.

A weapon meant to force an enemy into submission.

Zenyatta did not submit.

He let it pass him like wind slipping between temple bells.

She attacked again, the blade shifting from whip to rigid steel in a single instant, a perfect execution of the mercenary’s most practiced killing blow.

But it did not land.

Zenyatta had already stepped aside, as if he had known it was coming before she did.

He could see the movements of others from her.

For a moment, he thought that was all it was.

She was simply a machine carrying echoes of the past.

The whip lashed again, high, low, and high, forcing him into tighter movements.

But something felt different.

She was not hesitating.

She was not adjusting.

She was watching him.

She let the whip fall from her hand.

And then, she raised the soldier’s rifle.

A weapon of precision, of calculation.

A tool of war designed to erase hesitation.

She did not hesitate.

She fired.

The first shot, Zenyatta shifted just enough for the bullet to miss his shoulder.

The second, he was already gone, flowing out of its path like water slipping through fingers.

But then, she fired not where he was, but where he would be.

His gaze flickered toward her just slightly too late.

A bullet grazed his shoulder.

She had watched. She had learned.

But not copied.

Zenyatta closed the distance.

She let the rifle fall from her hands.

And this time, she fought without a weapon.

Zenyatta struck first.

Not with violence.

But with his whole body.

A single calculated strike, aimed for the center of her chest.

Eryth turned with it.

She absorbed the impact, redirected the force, the same way he had.

And in that moment, she was faster.

Her hand struck, palm against metal, an echo of his own motion.

Zenyatta’s balance shifted.

His body faltered.

She is not copying.

She is not just remembering.

She is understanding.

She was not a machine playing back data.

She was not a warrior stealing the style of another.

She carried it, because they had chosen to fight her.

She fought, because she had chosen, too.

And in that moment, Zenyatta made his own choice.

His breath slowed. His stance softened. Then he lowered his hands.

The battle was decided.

Eryth stopped.

Not because she didn’t know what to do.

But because there was nothing left to fight.

She stood over him. Staring.

Then, slowly, deliberately, she bowed.

Zenyatta watched her, unblinking.

And then, he bowed in return.

Not because she won.

Not because she lost.

But because, in the end, they both made a choice.

Then, without another word, she turned and walked away.

And before she left, she did what she had always done.

She took nothing from him.

No relic. No possession.

But the way he moved, that remained.

Later, when she was alone, she moved again.

The stance.

The breath she did not need.

The way his hands had turned, not to strike, but to guide.

She did not believe in balance.

She did not seek peace.

**And yet, the choice remained.**

Since season 10, i've been around master 2 - gm 4 since.

Recently, overwatch has stopped banning players using Xim. I used to get multiple messages a week about the cheaters i reported being banned. Now? not 1 message in MONTHS. People are using their main account to cheat and not even being banned anymore. Almost every game is a 3 or more stack with double hitscan xim with a egirl mercy pocket. Overwatch is no longer my main game, i'm simply not into playing ""double xim hitscan mercy egirl watch"" anymore. I want my galactic skins for my mains and with the change to competitive point gain and completive rewards, it's simply not worth it. Now i curb stomp bronze players on Tank and am getting skins quick. After i get my skins, i'm off to quick play for good

I know i'll get hate for throwing SO many games but i really don't care. Just want to put this out there. Maybe when Overwatch decides to ban the most obvious cheaters in existence  and not someone for 2 months for saying 1 curse word in game chat, more players will play ranked on console."

Changes I'd love to see in overwatch,Overwatch,0,1k3slay,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k3slay/changes_id_love_to_see_in_overwatch/,4,2025-04-20 20:04:50,"Long time a lurker here. Sometimes, when I play overwatch, I think of some changes I love to see made in the game. Some have a simple quality of life, and some are ridiculous. I'd love to know your thoughts? 

1. When heroes die, their abilities stop. Great nerfs for Brigs Inspire & Moiras Orbs.

2. When the hero dies, their deployable break. Once my dead life weaver got me killed because a widow used his pad to snipe me on Gibraltar. Great nerfs for Junkrat, Torb, Ilari, Winston, Ram & Sigma.

3. Grant a hero 100 temporary overhealth that depletes over time when picking up the flag on capture the flag. I but someone getting the flag and instantly dying is a vibe killer

4. Add perks to some of the arcade modes. Capture the Flag feels so outdated now.

5. Allow Mei to ping in enemies in her ice block

6. Bring back LFG. I know people said they never used it but that we before we had crossplay. Encouraging users of a team to leave a platform to build a team will never make sense to me.

7. Bring back temporary armour. It felt like a really fun concept that I think can be balanced around. Also, I felt like it added texture to the game.

8. Add lines on the floor for Clash. I know they added a marker, but trying to get your team to all rotate the same way after an objective has been captured is beyond frustrating.

9. Update the endorsement system. Make the perimeters of achieving each level public. Also, have reports & avoid impacting someone's endorsement level.

10. If someone leaves your team in competitive add a modifier to the rank lost. Even if it's just minor. I feel like some acknowledgement of having lost a losing battle would feel so much better "
"Sombra, Moira",Overwatch,0,1k3s537,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k3s537/sombra_moira/,5,2025-04-20 19:45:11,"I deal with both generally well as damage or support class but there's games where your team are negative k/d and will not group up, acknowledge danger pings or communication, like ""group up vs the sombra/Moira"" and just continuously die on a conveyor belt while playing like it's a singleplayer campaign

These 2 characters are the most picked among QP purely because this mode lacks coordination and they thrive on this. If either of them are backline and at least 2 teammates aren't marshalling together then it's pretty much game over. They mop 
the floor with casual fps players

It's also shown when players start the game as traditional gun heroes like soldier, soj, Cassidy, and then switch to sombra or Moira out of bitterness and begin actually putting up stat numbers - this happens A LOT! Players that can't commit to aiming will crutch these 2 broken characters




Sombra: virus 8 second, hack 10 second, translocator should only be usable when damage hasn't been received for 1-2 seconds because it's ridiculous seeing her players retreating from most fights instantly at the first sign of combat, only to have her cool-downs back in no time to begin harassing again

- This character type should be specialist, precision, requiring good judgment and planning, but currently her entire kit is just 'pick up & have immediate impact'. It's lazy and a waste of what could be an interesting hero


Moira: fade 9 seconds, this is my main gripe with her. It gives her too much agency for bad positioning and punishment of enemy dps/support players. If she had longer fade time then it would make her offense require good judgment because currently she is far too often used for mobility for players that are scared to commit to fights, much like the aforementioned Sombra

- I understand that she's a offensive support but the fact that most players who play her confidently chase and harass most dps/support(at least in QP) is a sign that she needs reworking from a development standpoint. I used her for quite some time 2 years ago and absolutely destroyed teams, yet felt next to no joy from doing this. She just feels broken. If they took her heal orb away and made her dps she would make much more sense than her current state in support 





Overall, I think Overwatch 2 needs longer ability replenishment times for most characters, something that would slow the pace down and make battles more memorable, skill-based. Currently most fights are a blender of ability spam and who 2v1's more often. Abilities should feel powerful, in the sense that they are potential gamechangers at the expense of messing up"

Hope you like it :3



Name: Turbotron

Nationality: Created in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil but born in São Paulo

Age: 27

Voice Actor: (unknown)

Role: DPS

Health: 200 

Weapon: Electric machine gun which generates blue energy shots that cause 50 damage at medium range, in addition to having 50 ammunition and having to wait 5 seconds to reload

Energy Ring: Located on Turbotron's back, it allows him to chase his enemies like a boomerang, causing 70 damage at close range, 50 at medium range and 30 at long range

Amplifying Acceleration: Turbotron launches a fast counterattack that allows him to become faster and his attacks and abilities are amplified for five seconds, consequently increasing the damage caused by 25%.

Ultimate: Brilliant Explosion: When it reaches 100%, Turbotron's ultimate ability allows the hero to overload his technological suit, causing everything around him to explode and cause heavy damage to nearby enemies at medium range, simply being in the middle of players on the enemy team increases its effectiveness.

Difficulty: 2 stars

Lore: Born into a humble and wise family, Pedro Alcântara de Silva was born during the reconstruction of the world after the Omnic Crisis. His father, Carlos Perez da Silva, served in the Brazilian Army and later joined Overwatch. His mother worked as a designer at Vishkar, always creative and wanting to make the world a better place for everyone. Despite everything, Pedro always wanted to become a driver in the world's famous single-seater category, Formula Lux. So he always trained and built karts with his mother's technology. Although his father was against it because he wanted his son to be a soldier like him, his mother supported it out of fear of the dangers of facing omnics and people with dangerous intentions. While still a child, the family moved from São Paulo to Rio de Janeiro, where Pedro met his great childhood friend, Lúcio Correia dos Santos. However, his childhood was already troubled, as Pedro had his first major trauma, which was the repeated death of his father, at the hands of the explosion of the Overwatch base in Switzerland. This shook the family, but it didn't prevented Pedro from achieving his dreams. Now an adult, Pedro progressed through the lower categories until he reached the elite of Formula Lux, where he attracted a lot of attention, being part of the strongest team on the grid, winning four world titles in his first four years, being a rising celebrity, but one big event shaped his life! In a race, precisely in Switzerland, a sniper named Widowmaker, was assigned by Talon to assassinate Pedro in order to create chaos, but luckily the lethal shot did not hit Pedro's head, but the car was still hit and so a terrible accident occurred, almost taking his life, then a well-known doctor named Ângela Ziegler helped Pedro saving his life, installing supports to his severely damaged body, but surviving, so Pedro, upon hearing the news and reading articles, discovered Talon's involvement in the attack, after the accident, Pedro's mind changed, ceasing to be arrogant and thinking about bed, becoming a force for good and someone more humble and kind, helping innocent people and bringing good to humanity by doing things really right! So he temporarily retires from racing and becomes a vigilante, acting in the shadows of the population and dedicated to serving the world, as his father once did!"

Moderators, I read through your rules regarding this topic and that's why I want to be as thorough and adhering as possible.

Devs, this post is purely created with the intention for you to investigate how and when this hardware is currently used (you are already aware, what it is used for as per your Spotlight Q&As). These players have been reported by everyone in my team without even asking them to, **they already knew from the start**.

**TLDR**; Comprehensive explanation to how Ximmers navigate comp. A problem invalidated too much during S15 that should be spoken about more **calmly and clearly** instead of angrily. Slight amount of personal experiences to better define the shape of the problem. Some ideas for solutions are shared. Location: EU. My replay code is just an example of MANY matches I and many others have had to deal with.

# 1. Introduction

I've wanted to make this post for a really long time, since about 20-25 days into S15, but I always held hope that things would resolve. I've seen so many posts from Platinum and Diamond players completely invalidated by higher rank users when they try to explain there's a new Xim epidemic. I hope for those players this post can be a bit of relief that you're not alone.

Below you will find two videos attached, each showing the perspective of Xim users on the Platinum, Diamond and Masters range (**synchronously**). For people who aren't aware of it, this is how it looks.

Might be jittery thumbs, new player who's just really good. Let's look further:

[I've censored half of the gamertag to prevent witchhunting. These short acronyms for \\""xim\\"", specifically this one, there are hundreds of them for different games, a lot of them for Overwatch as this is NOT the first time seeing it written in such a way.](https://preview.redd.it/ahl76myn1wve1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9318528628ec952eb1043f271026bbc98701cac6)

# 2. Why have I used the word 'epidemic'?

Since **right before the start of Season 15,** the increase of XIM users has been substantially visible. When Season 15 started, numerous rumors and posts have spread claiming that, as an emulator, XIM has managed to bypass current rules and can camouflage itself as a controller more than before. People report these findings through digging in their forums, finding that **a new patch went out** which is highly believable considering how different it feels **now**. There are people proudly posting XIM montages on popular platforms such as Instagram, Tiktok, Youtube, further incentivizing players who have **felt left out** (common phrase used: *""everyone is ximming, you might as well xim too""* or **cheated out of the system** buying this prohibited hardware. Remember my word usage: **Increase**.

# 3. How easily this can happen, and why ban waves aren't necessarily the answer:

First of all, I hope I don't sound rude by claiming your current measures aren't the answer, but I'd like to explain myself with what I mean by the heading. It's what I call ""availability"". Ximmers follow 3 very routine steps (which I won't go into detail to prevent this spread):

1. Account creation (estimated time required \~5 minutes if the account isn't bought, this includes email etc.)
2. (Not necessarily, but almost always the case) an Xbox LFG Post titled something like ""50 QP wins quick"", ""need 50 qp wins will carry"", ""need **mercy** for 50qp wins"". Of course, a lot of these posts can just be smurf accounts, however they purposefully place the tag ""#xim"", so...
3. Competitive access comes right after the player has reached placements.

**Let me be clear, ban waves are totally ineffective to cheaters who genuinely enjoy playing Overwatch.** They will NOT stop creating 5-minute alt accounts to Xim with, and that's without mentioning the hidden economical gains behind boosting. **Ban -> account creation. A ceaseless loop.**

How often does this happen? There's no objective data. From my personal experience, hardcore Xim users appear 6 to 14+ times a week. It also depends on if it's the same ximmers, because that does happen.

# 3.a. What happens during and after the placement matches (lengthy explanation of scenarios ahead):

**SPECIFIC TO PLATINUM - DIAMOND - MASTER (M5 - M3+) the matchmaking is COMPLETELY destroyed. The ximmers, at their own benefit, disrupt the match for everybody in multiple senses.**

*With the current knowledge that everybody in these ranks knows when somebody is ximming 20 seconds into a match);*

1. Team A (not a full stack) has a ximmer, they stop playing like they usually would and either let the ximmer do whatever they want for the win, or they try to disrupt the ximmer (far too rare). Team A's players, without the ximmer, will go into the next match ending with a loss due to a confused matchmaker, facing the ximmer they had on their team thereby wasting ∼40 minutes' worth of comp session, or (personal issue) overconfidence. This is almost a guarantee from the research I tried to conduct with people I asked.
2. Team A, game 2. A full stack with 1 (or more) ximmers who are boosting. This is an automatic loss for the non-ximmer team below Masters, but admittedly it does depend on if you're in a ""mirrored"" Masters lobby, just because the game sense is better and things like this are easier to coordinate. Of course this does not excuse the behavior at all, and it still likely causes a landslide disparity/loss.
3. What ximmers like to do: mass report if they lose, and it works! Yeah, for some reason this is really common, then they come back with fresh accounts and do it all over again. Your main gets suspended, and they pop out like whack-a-moles for several more rounds.

*Side tip: this wasn't about chatting, but it reminds me to say this: don't risk defending yourself in chat when a ximmer is being toxic to you, they will tell everyone to report you for anything under communication. Report them for harassing you and move on.*

4. Common knowledge, but like with smurf accounts, the matchmaker is tilted and confused with who to place where because of ximmers. **How often this happens seems to be making the problem far worse**.

Short anecdote: During my D4 matches, I had one where the enemy team was a full gold team with a ximmer who had the game sense of an M5. The ximmer went 33 - 5 and the rest of their team were all below 10 kills each, with multiple deaths and accounts showing gold gold gold. None of them seem to have had a grasp of what was happening. That team did not lose because ours was better, they lost because my whole team focused the solo ximmer who was **likely boosting that account they were playing on. The ximmer stopped trying on round 2 and stayed AFK, making the opposite team -1 DPS. The thing is, ximmers on alt accounts don't have to care, because it does not affect their main account.**

5. D4 to M5: **You will get ximmers or people boosted by Xim usage in your team who have absolutely no idea what they're doing.** This is especially frustrating when you watch post-match replays and they aren't even at Platinum level; it is blatantly obvious they didn't get there through sheer grind and it even seems that they're throwing on purpose at first. It is worse when you see they've been ximming and making you lose. These are losses nobody needs, losses we annoyingly get over when we say, ""it happens"".

This is what people are frustrated about when (on console) people ask, ""has anyone else seen bots in Diamond or just me?"". **Ximmers usually have aim and strafe that can't be matched, but they severely lack in game awareness and that is how real players are able to tell them apart.**

6. Mercy pockets Sojourn/Ashe/Soldier: you die in two seconds from any type of burst. This is the one everybody is familiar with and why console folks want to ban Mercy. While I have personal qualms against damage boost, this is **NOT** a Mercy issue.

This one is slightly harder to put into words, but you can tell when pocket hitscans are ximming or not. There is a certain feeling to it that assures you, and unless you get to see what their accounts look like, positioning needs to heavily be considered (5.).

7. Higher rank players need to **stop invalidating Platinum players**, because many of these Ximmers fall out of their placement ranks and get quickly calibrated as low as Platinum 5. Devs, if you're reading this, I hope you are aware of this too.

# 4. Through my own opinion, these are possible solutions I can think of (opinions on 3 are appreciated):

1. Many people will hate to see me type this, I know, but re-enabling phone verification for console like it is on PC might be the play that can help a lot. I personally think console players can't be trusted anymore, to be honest with you, most randoms I end up adding as friends already have a decorated BattleNet account anyways... This would also cut down smurfing by at least half, which, even if it isn't against TOS, majority of the playerbase would appreciate.
2. **Increasing the FOV**. While this seems like a technical issue currently, I think it would be beneficial to combat Ximmers. Xim users, unless they're on Genji, make themselves as untouchable as possible because they can't risk the so called ""delay"" they """"have"""". They often put themselves in godspots and heavens, where nobody in their rank would play on for more than 1 minute at a time. These spots are often hard to see with the current low FOV, that's my point.
3. 50 QP wins aren't enough for a common player to understand Overwatch. I think this should be extended far more, maybe double. An original idea I had is something that would surely bother these cheaters the most: if they had to wait out a specific timer on the brand-new account, like ""**competitive unlocks in 10-30 days**"".

Doing something like this carries two benefits: an uptick of account creations for Overwatch which can be closely monitored and perhaps bracketed; players coming back to Overwatch or players excited for the new season are (for the most part) worry-free for at least 10-30 days.

4. **Break the sequence**. I've explained to you what the basic process for a ximmer looks like. There has to be a way to train Defense Matrix to see that: a new user doing 50 quickplay wins, also accompanied by a Mercy pocket with above average capabilities, heading right into comp once they're done and smashing through placements should be an immediate flag for the system.

5. IP bans. No explanation needed. People accused of cheating when they are on controller are completely fine (or so I hope), the game detects controllers, 0 aim smoothing etc. We in Diamond and (M5 for me) have all been reported for cheating one way or another and nothing happened because we're on controller. But a brand-new account that is detected by Defense Matrix and placed into ""PC lobbies until they stop doing it"" is not a solution, in fact it **makes the problem even worse.**

Now PC players have to deal with ximmers, who (I'm pretty sure) have had their aim assist revoked, so they get a cheater deadweight on their team. But not only that, **what's worse is that ximmers use this as a bell to alert them when their account is compromised.** That is their prime time for creating a new one and being stealthier about it (or not!). People detected of ximming 100% by the system need to be IP banned if they can't be hardware banned. Cheaters have no reason to be in a competitive FPS like Overwatch, or any other competitive FPS for that matter.

# 5. Conclusion

I will fully cooperate if more details are needed, and I don't claim to be an expert. I'm just another gamer who waited too long to post about it. I love Overwatch, especially now with these exciting seasons, but this is undeniably disgusting, and it has gotten out of hand. Like senior system designer Gavin Winter said, these cheaters are holding people with disabilities hostage by abusing third party accessories.

So what happens in the match that made me post this? Within 20 seconds my whole team knew there were ximmers, this was at like midnight, and we were all chillin. I was in a duo, the rest were randoms. The Winston was really good actually, but even he didn't care either. None of us did, so we messed around and did what we wanted, going for kills on whoever we saw. All of them were kind, we all endorsed each other and wished each other a goodnight. Classically the Dva on the opposite team says ""gg"" after the ximmers make their clips.

It is unknown who was being boosted, but we suspect the Ana was. Her profile showed gold-plat hardstuck and suddenly this season she's Masters with extremely slow reflexes. As someone who worked very hard to reach M5 last year, I would never place that Ana above P4.

If you made it this far, thank you so much for taking your time reading this!

"There is no ""I"" in Team, but there are four ""I""s in Individualized Ladder - Why Overwatch ranking feels strange and what other sports have known for a long time",Overwatch,0,1k2ywny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k2ywny/there_is_no_i_in_team_but_there_are_four_is_in/,22,2025-04-19 17:31:17,"Everyone puts so much emphasis on this being a team game. I agree with that but, **if you look at the top 500, you will see a list of individual players. This would make sense in a game that is based off of 1v1s. If Overwatch is truly a ""team game"" there would be a ladder of Teams, not Individuals.** Look at the ladder of any team sport and any 1v1 sport and you will see what I mean. **Could you imagine if Soccer was ranked individually like Overwatch? This type of system breeds toxicity.**

**Blizzard needs a BOTH an Individual and Team Ladder system** much like how they did it in StarCraft 2 to be a competitive game.

I think this is the source of a lot of issues in the current ranking system. In order for individual ranking to make sense, Blizzard would need to award individual ladder points to players every game weighted by performance.

**Yes, this is a complex team game. Yes, there is more to this game than just the damage/heals on the scoreboard, there is intricate teamwork involved. But the current ladder is not about a team, it's about one person - you.**

Example: A high Plat level player and a Silver level player only DuoQ. They ONLY play together all the time everytime. The game will rank them both at Gold. If individual stats were taken into account these players would eventually diverge in rank even if they played together all the time and that is what we SHOULD be seeing. But that does not happen."

# Chapter 8: The Question Without an Answer

The last of the three was Zenyatta.

By the time they met, she had already walked many battlefields. Already earned a reputation. A polite monster. A courteous storm. A force of destruction with no allegiance.

Zenyatta sought her out.

She found him sitting beneath a ruined temple, as if he had been waiting.

“Did you come to change me?” she asked, her tone quiet. Not expectant. Not dismissive. Simply waiting.

“No,” he said simply. “Only to know you.”

That was the difference between him and the others.

Mondatta had wanted to save her.

Ramattra had wanted to use her.

Zenyatta only wanted to understand.

So she sat with him. And they spoke.

They met many times over the years. She would appear after battles, sitting beside him like an old friend.

And they spoke.

“You do not seek peace,” Zenyatta said.

“But do you seek meaning?”

She was quiet for a moment.

“I don’t think about meaning.”

“Then why do you fight?”

She considered the question, not for the first time.

“Because I choose to.”

“And that is enough?”

She tilted her head, watching him.

“Should it not be?”

Zenyatta chuckled softly.

“Perhaps it is.”

The day would come, of course, when words were not enough.

She would tilt her head and say, “Would you like to fight me, Zenyatta?”

And he would nod. “Yes.”

Not to stop her.

Not to teach her.

**But simply because it was his choice to do so.**

This has made me realise how wierd the higher end distribution is

The EU console top 500 leaderboard currently starts at Master 2 which seems ridiculous to me. How can top 500 span the entirety of Champion, Grandmaster and about 1/3 of masters. For the support role there's currently a grand total of 23 people in Champion and not a single person above Champion 4.

To me this seems like such a waste of the ranks, there's a total of 40 ranked divisions in overwatch and 12 of them are only for the top 500 players. That's 30% of the scale for 500 individuals. Why can't the entirety of top 500 be within the Champion rank?

I couldn't find anyone else talking about this so I wanted to hear some of your opinions. Surely it would benefit the community to spread the current top 500 over Champion or at least high Grandmaster and then spread the remaining ranks downwards"

new 5v5 play in quick play and competitive. 

new competitive modes: clash, push, flashpoint

tons of new skins, including EPIC which has special effects and customization

new exclusive weapon skins

overhaul of competitive with ranked reset

all new perk system for heroes to unlock in all modes as they level through the match. 

new way to play: STADIUM 

new heroes: junker queen, mauga, ramatra, hazard, freja, venture, sojourn, lifeweaver, juno, illiari, kiriko

hero reworks: doomfist moved to tank, orisa kit change, sombra kit change

new items: trophies, weapon charms

After 8 years…. I finally got the Overwatch Platinum Trophy.,Overwatch,46,1k2cptf,https://i.redd.it/gzmsll545nve1.jpeg,17,2025-04-18 20:59:20,"June 2017 — that’s when I first picked up Overwatch. I had no idea this game would become more than just a hobby. It became a journey, a part of my life, my favorite game of all time.

Fast forward to 2025, and I’ve just done what only 0.2% of PlayStation players have done:
Unlocked the Platinum Trophy on Overwatch.

This isn’t a story of cheesing or luck.
This is about the long game. The frustrations. The team kills denied by 1 HP.
It’s about hours of climbing, learning, adapting — and yes, asking for help when needed.

The hardest trophies?
	•	Junkrat Cute – got it with my brother. That was a moment.
	•	Reaper Pixel (Waste Not, Want Not) – took coordination and planning, had to ask in QP.
	•	Zenyatta Pixel – possibly the hardest of all. Needed perfect timing, perfect positioning, and teammates worth saving.

And I’m not ashamed to say it: I typed in matches asking for help. Not because I’m weak — but because after 8 years, I wasn’t letting this goal slip away due to matchmaking RNG or sweaty lobbies.

I recorded the moment. And honestly? I just sat there for a second, soaking it in.
This wasn’t just a trophy. It was a tribute.
To the time I’ve spent. The love I have for this game. The players I’ve met. The memories I’ve made.

I’m not quitting Overwatch anytime soon. This platinum doesn’t mark the end. It marks my place in its legacy.

To the 0.2% out there — I see you.
To the rest — keep going. Your moment will come."

I'm Bronze 1 in every role/OQ, and I know how everyone feels about metal ranks in this subreddit.

But this matchmaking that I thought was atrocious before? It's 100x worse with the Drive event going on. Completely unbalanced teams, people playing like it's their first day in comp getting 0 kills with 3k damage, not listening to any pings whatsoever.... And then taking one look at the scoreboard and blaming ""my stats"" for the whole team losing instead of horrible positioning or 15 different bad plays that everyone takes.

It's so entirely frustrating. Drive Score is deducted upon loss, and you only get 150 points upon winning. 5 losses in a row after 1 win and you're right back at 0 as if you hadn't even played in the first place. And no, I'm not ""tilted"", nor should I be taking a break after 2 losses. I play maybe 1-2 nights a week, so I'm going to utilize my time to the best of my ability.

Overwatch dev team: fix your matchmaking. No one can get better if the enemy team consistently steam rolls you because you've been paired up with people who are far below even your ""Bronze 1"" rank. I'm over it.

Sincerely,

A player who loves your game, but can't stand the toxic players or the atrocious matchmaking (or the lack of penalties for people leaving matches early constantly)."

Overwatch Devs have been cooking recently,Overwatch,840,1jztlg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1jztlg4/overwatch_devs_have_been_cooking_recently/,172,2025-04-15 16:41:27,"Let's be honest, OW2's development history has been... troubled. When PVE was cancelled we all thought it was the end. Now, come season 15, Overwatch has turned the corner and the future is looking super bright.

Perks - Obviously this was, no pun intended, a game changer. Perks have kept me and many others hooked for much longer than I thought, they completely change the approach to games whilst still keeping that core experience. Whoever came up with the idea deserves a raise.

New heroes - Hazard in particular was a big success and proved that the devs CAN continue to make fun, balanced tanks in 5v5. Freja looks to be nothing groundbreaking but still fun with a good design. Changes to Lifeweaver and Mauga have also been really good and made them a lot less frustrating.

Stadium - I thought stadium was going to be a gimmicky side show to the main modes of OW. Seeing that trailer made me realise just how fleshed out it is! A tournament like mode with skill trees, ranks, unique abilities, etc sounds incredibly fun and I can't wait til it releases in a week! 

6v6 - A big issue for a long time. Extending the 6v6 Open Queue to all of next season is perfect, think it should remain permanent. People now have a choice of 5v5 or 6v6 depending on their preference, I think that's fantastic!

Loot boxes - A fantastic and consumer friendly way to keep people playing. It's a shame they'll be reducing the amount, hopefully not by the number being rumoured, but getting anything for free is still nice!

Balance - Say what you will about balance (I know I have my opinions *cough cough why is Sojourn STILL hard meta*) but at the very least they are willing to do hot fix patches on a whim, even for the april fools event! I think that element can be praised whilst still having reservations about some other decisions.

All in all I think it goes without saying that the devs have really been hitting it out of the park recently. People calling them ""lazy"" is just plain wrong. There are OF COURSE still issues with OW, and there always will be, but the decisions of Aaron and the team have lead the game to a healthy state of growth and competition. I think that deserves praise."
Overwatch 2 counter culture,Overwatch,0,1js624q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1js624q/overwatch_2_counter_culture/,19,2025-04-05 17:31:42,"Why has counter culture gotten so bad in ow2

I am a tank player with 1000+ hours on this game, and I usually play casual qp with my friends. What is wrong with this games counter culture that has the enemy team instantly counter swapping on their first death

I don’t even have to be a problem for me to be met with a hard counter when they respawn. I have ZERO problems with counter swapping, counter swapping is much better than being stomped one sidedly

 But I am sick and tired of being insta countered 9 in 10 games that I play just for queuing tank, and the people who try to defend this insta counter play style even when I try to mirror, especially in qp.

And fed up with YouTubers and TikTok creators telling people to “play this counter against this tank” to always win. As it stands, I think the counters were way less prevalent compared to the start ow2. And I think this is a really big reason why, and likely also the reason why the metal ranks felt the most terrible to climb out of out of all ranks, as the majority of these players usually stay below diamond and masters

The perks help, but it is rarely useful against the counters that just go completely over them, and just now I went 30ish games where I had 5 games that I wasn’t Insta countered, and only two of them, where I wasn’t countered at all. 

It was manageable during the early seasons as I could just play qp to escape the counters but I’m finding lots of these players even there. And I don’t like playing better as it just results in more counters. And sweatier games for people trying to play in a “casual” setting

So I ask again, why, why has counter culture gotten so bad to stoop to where it is now in ow2"

Perks were a massive addition and 6v6 with this many tank combos feels by far better than 5v5, and thats coming from someone who really enjoyed 5v5. Push even feels x10 better and probably my 3rd favorite mode. fights feel longer and the map feels more filled out.

My only problem is some of the perks (although really good), are boring choices. Orisa gaining 100 health on fortify is great, but completely lacks the fantasy appeal of changing her spin to shield or charging jav.

Now the question is: Where do they go with this? Can we establish 6v6 as a core gamemode with hero bans?"
Some tanks in 6v6 need “Zarya Adjustments”,Overwatch,1,1jm34z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1jm34z7/some_tanks_in_6v6_need_zarya_adjustments/,4,2025-03-28 20:18:11,"In the 6v6 mode, Zarya’s bubbles work like they did in OW1, which means she can’t double bubble herself or a teammate. This is good because it means Zarya can’t hold an aggressive position for a ridiculous amount of time while also having a second tank to absorb even more pressure. Double bubble is required for 5v5 solo tanking but would be unfair in 6v6.

However some of the other tanks haven’t been adjusted like this and feel annoying to play against

Hazard is a prime suspect. He was designed to be a solo tank that has almost constant uptime which dosnt work in 6v6. I suggest his block be made a cooldown like like doomfist or changed completely. You don’t really need his block so much in 6v6 anyway.

Roadhog’s vape is still on a a resource meter, again make it a cooldown like it use to be. With a second tank roadhog dosnt need to be constantly on the front line. If his vape gets cancels or anti naded, you had a second tank to abosorb the pressure while he resets. The resource meter just gives him to much uptime.

I don’t think Ramatra should be able to block in 6v6. At least not how it is implemented now. He already has a shield, allow him to deploy it while in nemesis mode and maybe give it a shorter cooldown(the shield). But being able to place a shield and then block damage for 8 seconds is too much in 6v6. 

Mauga doesn’t need a 50% damage mitigation on his charge. CC immunity is fine but both is too much. With a second tank to help absorb pressure, he is fine without it.

Sigma is a OW1 tank that was a OW2 tank before before it came out. He has range damage, a shield, a matrix and a stun. Sure he has no mobility (baring perk) but this is still a bulky kit for 6v6. I would significantly reduce the shield health, or make its cooldown between uses longer. Instead of 2 seconds it’s 3 or 4. I would go with health nerf since that the cooldown nerf might lose some of the fluidity that’s makes Sigma satisfying to play. I don’t want to gut his identity as a main and off tank hybrid but he cant do everything all at once.

Hammond has been super annoying to play against in 6v6. It is way too hard to kill him. I’m not to sure how I would change him but maybe getting rid of his base shield health could be a start. Maybe replace more of his armor health with base health. 

I think JQ, Rein, Dva, Zarya, Doom and Winston, are fine. "

But looking at balance patches from the last year or two, I've noticed developers tend to keep certain heroes perpetually in top positions. Despite these heroes being widely acknowledged as overpowered, developers won't take action - especially with **Ana**. I don't know how long this old cute lady has dominated the competitive ladder, but after introducing perks, her perk might have given her the biggest boost in the game. Clearly, developers have never considered reducing her terrifying pick rate. Since OW2 launched, Ana's only period of weakness came during Season 9 when healing reduction mechanics were introduced, but subsequently her biotic grenade was buffed to 90 damage.
* The latest balance patch makes this phenomenon increasingly intolerable. Developers previously admitted that **Pharah** and **Ana** benefited most from perks, so why haven't they been restricted? Pharah even received buffs, along with heroes like **Genji** who are clearly not underpowered. Meanwhile, Torbjörn, who had just recently started showing potential, was immediately nerfed. What's the basis for their balancing decisions? Similarly with **Lifeweaver**, developers have never stopped buffing her to increase his play rate, and this patch continues that trend. What about **Moira** and **Mercy** \- don't they deserve significant buffs to make them viable options?
* The design philosophy behind perks is also laughable. I suspect they didn't even hold a meeting to discuss the design approach. Many heroes have completely different design principles. For example, Ana received substantial improvements **without any trade-offs** (like getting two Nano Boosts without reducing duration). Some heroes make sacrifices for their perks, like Sombra and Junkrat. And some heroes' changes are so ridiculous they seem like April Fools' mode. If they rushed these perks to production just to create so-called internet buzz at their spotlight event, that's somewhat understandable, but it's been over a month - haven't they had time to establish unified principles and standards for perk design?

"Haven’t played the game in a long time, what happened to using mics and communicating with your team?",Overwatch,0,1jbb2f4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1jbb2f4/havent_played_the_game_in_a_long_time_what/,34,2025-03-14 19:46:23,"Me and my friend picked up OW2 again recently after not playing for years, been having a lot of fun with the new characters and perk system. We mainly play competitive and after placing silver (kinda rusty lol) and grinding through to plat, we log in to find myself muted from all communications for 2 weeks and my friend banned from playing for 2 weeks. 

We play the game with our mics open—I remember back in it’s heyday people were always on comms, and generally were pretty willing to talk out tactics and coordinate during a match, even in quick play. Now we get one person using their mic every 5 games or so if we’re lucky. We do always encourage people to join vc in the text chat too, and even when they do it usually just means they hear what we say but do not speak themselves. 

Like I said, we keep mics open, so offhand remarks about needing heals or asking what our teammates are doing are heard by everyone. I do vocally thank healers and call out good plays and generally we try to encourage our team to work together and do a good job. But when noone is willing to communicate verbally, people seem to take these suggestions the wrong way (as personal criticism) when it’s more thinking out loud than anything, and trying to keep everyone on the same page (I.e. asking an Ana to hold her nano a little later next time instead of using it on me when my ult is at 90%). 

It just seems like a lot of people are very quick to report now and the report system does seem to be very harsh—a 2 week communications ban is wild, especially when im usually the only one trying to communicate. Now I can’t even attempt to coordinate with my team. It feels like I’m  being punished for engaging with the communication systems instead of other players being punished for refusing to communicate if that makes sense. 

Idk, I feel like using a mic should be expected especially in ranked and even if not why report players that are very transparent about wanting better communication and participation with their team? I have never reported anyone in this game for any reason other than sandbagging or intentional throwing. If a tank asking for better communication with their healers bothers some people… just mute me? Why report if I’m just trying to help us win?? 

This turned into a kind of huge rant but it’s very frustrating that most players these days are not willing to cooperate or communicate, and it ends up punishing the players that do try. Maybe it’s just me but I feel like it’s much harder to win a match when noone wants to talk and I jsut miss when people in this game actually did talk to each other, I feel like the social element has completely disappeared :("

Support is the most overpowered role in entire game.,Overwatch,0,1j4ec2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1j4ec2q/support_is_the_most_overpowered_role_in_entire/,11,2025-03-05 22:20:43,"It's no surprise that supports have always been in a good spot in Overwatch, from characters with 3 healthbars (looking at you Baptiste) to characters that have more damage than actual DPSs, its safe to say that the role has always been the most overtuned (atleast since the start of OW2, because thats when i started playing the game more often).

With the introduction of perks, they made what was already broken even more broken. It makes playing any other roles that isn't support a miserable experience (most of the time), because not only do they have the best abilities in the game, they do what the DPSs can do, but better.

Lets take a look at Kiriko for example.

She can 2 tap headshot 225 HP targets (used to be most characters in the game before the season 9 hp changes), with 0 falloff. 

She also has an near instant TP that is undoubtedly the best movement ability in the game. Aside from getting her out of any danger it also cleanses debuffs.

She has also wallclimb which helps her to get to high places and to survive longer (like waiting for TP to come off cooldown, for example).

She has the one of, if not the best ability in the game with Suzu, that completely voids ultimates.

Her ultimate is a teamfight win button.

Perks gave her a way to heal while still doing her insane damage, alongside double TP.

  
This is a hot take, farfetched and all, but Kiriko really feels like a better version of Tracer, even though one is a DPS and the other is a support. The difference is you don't need to have good mechanics on Kiriko when you just aim at head level and strafe accordingly, you don't have to take as much risks to do damage because she has 0 falloff, which makes her superior mobility even better, because you don't need to use it to engage. You don't need  to aim to ult, and it even wins fights on its own and can't be cancelled at all (only if you REALLY mess up and ult infront of a doom with punch or something). It's CRAZY that you can go full ego  on anyone with Kiriko and get away with it. Are you being forced out? Don't worry, just press SHIFT! It's only a 7 second cooldown!

You get the idea! Most if not all support perks are simply straight upgrades to their already overloaded kit, like Ana with 2 nades and 2 nanos for example.

I wouldn't mind this much if all heroes got the same treatment, but it's not equally distributed all around. There are lots of characters that just got niche/situational perks such as Venture.

Support is easily the most babied role in the entire game, not just from these perks alone, but through the entirety of OW. I could go on and on, but i think you get the idea.

  
I'd really like to see the dev team for once making actual impactful nerfs. Start by removing the damage reduction from Ana's nano on herself, for example. Give Kiriko faloff, cast time on her TP, suzu nerfs etc etc. I am glad that they are listening, because if the DPS passive from Season 9 (arguably the only good thing about that patch) wasn't implemented, it would be a complete nightmare.

What do you think? Should the role stay as it is, or does it need changes?"

I've mostly heard it being the perks, which looking at them I have to assume it relates to her survivability with Recall now (getting health back and getting all her dashes back), and I've seen some stuff about the DPS passive, but I'm not sure if there's anything more than that. I've mostly been on the casual side of things these days, so it's mostly just me being nosey. Everything I've looked up hasn't given too much info, or is from last year."

HyPn0MaN
> Which perks had the highest impact on hero performance? Will perks have a higher priority in terms of balance than base hero perks, or will we see a combination of both going forward?

Alec: 

Some of the winners so far have been Ana, Bastion, Pharah, Ramattra, and Winston. When it comes to individual perks: Ramattra's Vengeful Vortex, Mauga's Firewalker, Zarya's Energy Lance, and Soldier 76's Agility training have all been quite impactful. It's important though to look at the combination of your Minor and Major perks, what rank thresholds players are using them at, and how quickly a hero is gaining their perks. There's still quite a bit for us to dig through there!

In the immediate, we mostly plan on balancing perks in order to make them feel more impactful. There will still be some core kit tuning alongside that, but there's still a meaningful amount of change we want to inject into the system throughout the next few patches. Tuning to perks and actual perk swaps (hoping for some in 16.0) are included in that.

> I was really looking forward to see the old 2CP maps reworked. Oh, and speaking of old maps, any hope for Gothenburg to get a second life one day?

Alec: 

Like you, I also believe Clash is awesome when it all comes together! We actually spent a good amount of time on Clash's scoring before we made the decision to pull it from Competitive. Even with scoring changes, we believed the mode needed some fundamental geo changes to points A+E to perform better as a Competitive mode. Currently we are experimenting with building another Clash map from the ground up with a different approach to the layout to see if that solves some of the core issues the mode has. That's all very early, but hopefully some significant geo changes along with scoring changes can get Clash into a great spot.

> 1. Chicken or egg question - did Junkenstein revenge's success serve as the spark for building a new game mode with talents more permanently into the game? Or was this always in the back of mind given the amount of work that has gone into talents since OW2's development?

> 2. What was the thinking behind limiting perks down to just 2X2 choices and is this something that you think could change in the future? I personally really enjoyed how more choices really lead to different early and late game experiences

Alec

1. Actually neither! The true impetus for this was our need for a game system layer to introduce more change into the core game. Having some talents to pull from was nice to have but a large majority of the perks were built for the perk system specifically. The team had gotten really great at expanding kits, so there was plenty of good experience for us to bring good learnings into building perks. Junkenstein's Lab gave us more signal for Stadium and how much we could expand the bounds of an Overwatch match while still making it feel like Overwatch.
2. We played with a number of different iterations. Originally we had three levels but there was no choice, didn't feel very different. Some iterations later we gave players their Minor Perks passively but you had a choice between two Major Perks later on in the game. We really liked the choice that gave, so decided to bring it in earlier at the Minor Perk level. Overall, we felt this was the right amount of change to introduce initially. We were changing some of fundamentals of how Overwatch worked and were trying to measure how much we could disrupt that. Maybe we could've gone even farther, but I think we are in a good place for now and with time we'll see how far the playerbase wants us to take systems like this.

ApostLeOW 
> How does the team decided who gets the ""fun perks"", like (pharah, Kiriko, ana), who gets the ""new ability"" perks, (bastion, orisa, torbjorn), and who just gets number buffs? (Reaper, Genji) Are the number buffs just placeholders, with plans to go more extreme in the future to match the other heroes?

Alec

Well the goal overall is to make fun perks for every hero! That can be more difficult on certain heroes though, as boosting certain elements of their kits can cause issues. Currently, the number buff perks are some of the perks we like the least and plan on changing a handful of those over time. This initial launch has given us plenty of signal on which perk combinations players find compelling and which ones they don't!

Think it's important for us to stay true to our values for Minor and Major perks. Your Minor Perks are supposed to be lighter, nice little upgrades. Your Major Perks are supposed to be transformative. We have some work to hit that goal for all of the heroes and offering more transformative Major Perks.

RobManfredsFixer
> Do you view perks as a way to limit the counterpicking and power spikes of certain heroes? If so, do you think they have shown early signs of achieving that and what adjustments would you make going forward? Any examples of heroes you'd want to shore up in that respect?

Alec

We did want to add more friction to counterswapping and we've seen that drop quite a bit since Season 15's launch. It'll be some time before players settle on how much less they want to counterswap but in Ranked Role Queue we've seen players swap about 25% less and more so at the highest ranks (Masters+ players swap much more than the ranks below that).
 
For power spikes, the goal of the perk system isn't to limit power spikes. We actually introduced more power spikes and hopefully more texture to your individual hero's moment to moment gameplay through the perks system. We think a number of our heroes needed bigger moments than they had previously.

Going forward, we are looking at raising up some of the less impactful perks and making sure you feel there's a real choice between your Minors and Majors. We have a lot of opportunity to make that choice more interesting by cutting out some of perks players aren't gravitating towards. Things like Roadhog's increased Pig Pen throw distance.

No32
> In the Spotlight, Alec mentioned a “refresh” of the perks in the middle of the year. Does that mean 4 brand new perks for everyone? Saw someone mention Aaron said something along those lines but couldn’t find where.
> 
> Or is it more like a few perks will be changed out or tweaked if desperately needed here and there before the refresh, and the refresh is more thorough for perks that are less lopsided and not 4 brand new perks for everyone?

Alec

The goal there would be that every hero gets at least one new perk to play with! Still scoping out what that refresh would look like for Season 18, but somewhere around 25-50% of the perks changing (some being completely new and some receiving significant tuning). If we have perks that players really love, we don't want to immediately remove those and the refresh would be looking at perks that are more middling in interest.
 
We'd also like to evaluate how the perks system functions overall at that point too. That could include changes to the catchup mechanics, gain rates, or even a starting level choice. Those are fairly early discussions though and how this season goes will give us good insight of where to take perks next.

OnceToldTale
> What were some interesting perks that the team scrapped along the way?

Alec

We played with a variety of movement perks for heroes that don't have much mobility. We wanted to see if we could do a movement perk for Torbjorn. I think it only lasted a playtest or two but Torbjorn could launch himself off of his turret by double jumping on it. And the idea was that if you had the Sticky Turret, you could change the angle of that leap and catapult yourself into backlines. Maybe we will come back to that one day, was certainly silly!

Nobbs89
> Are there any ideas to make Mystery Heroes mode less stomping with new perks? Currently perk system is another advantage that a winning team have compare to the team who's currently loosing. I know it's just a non-competitive mode with no big priority, although it has a huge playerbase.

Alec

We have a fix for this coming next week actually. You'll get two random perks (one Minor and one Major) each time you spawn.

Conflux
> What's the overall design goals/pillars for perks?
> 
> For some, heroes perks seem to be covering weakness they may have (Pharah's Drift thrusters, or Reaper's Dire Triggers), while other perks seem to allow players more skill expression (Sigma's Massive Impact, or Ana's Biotic bounce), and some perks just seem odd or unfitting for the hero (Sombra's White Hat or Moira's Contamination).
> 
> Is there a set philosophy for perks that can be shared with the community? Because it seems like perks are trying to solve a lot of problems in the sandbox.

Alec

Perks are mainly about creating new things for your heroes to do, increasing situational viability, and giving you more agency over your in-match experience.
 
For that goal of increasing the amount of situations in which a hero can be viable: That can come through via shoring up weaknesses against certain heroes, that can also come through by adding mobility so certain heroes can be played on more maps. That goal led to perks like Junkrat's Frag Cannon, Sigma's Levitation, and many more.
 
For perks like Sombra's White Hat, that is fulfilling a particular hero fantasy that many players wanted us to lean into and we think that's an interesting opportunity the perks system creates. Over time, we'll see how players respond to some of those more off the wall ones.

> 
> Finally, do you have any desire to ever add another level to perks (either something in between minor and major, or even something above major)?

Kenny

We're going to start rotating in some new perks in Season 16, but before we get there we've got a bunch of balance changes and tweaks coming in the Season 15 midcycle patch, and there are good things coming for some underperforming perks.

Things like: Hog Toss now increasing the damage of Pig Pen, Juno's double jump reset perk is also going to increase the duration of glide boost. On the other end of the spectrum, Bastion's self repair resource meter is coming back.

We did a ton of iteration on how many levels perks should come with. There were versions with 2 levels up through I think 4, and even one where you eventually had all minor and major perks. 3 levels has been the sweet spot for a while, but that's not to say the system can't evolve. Still a bit early, but its a system that can evolve if need be.

ModWilliam

> Was pre-selecting perks / perk presets ever considered?

Kenny

We did discuss the idea of pre-selecting perks and the original design even had an interface for them as a loadout in the hero gallery. But once we started playtesting the abilities themselves, there were a lot of situations where we'd want to go with a different perk based on the situation at hand. Being locked into a choice made prior to really being 100% on what you would want to choose felt like a worse option than always giving yourself options. That's not to say this couldn't change as people get used to the choices and their playstyles with perks become a bit more cemented though.

Cryptographer

> What is a primary weapon archetype you either want to fit in that you haven't yet, or think is at the very least under explored?

Kenny

The one weapon that always comes up during the ""what's next"" discussion is the flame thrower. We'd love to get one in, but it's gotta be epic.

ModWilliam

> Do we have any stats on which perk selections are the most one-sided? E.g. one perk is picked over the other 90% of the time

Scott

We do have stats that show perk selection rates per hero. I would say it's variable depending on the hero and the rank that they're being selected. In general, when a perk has an incredibly high pick rate, it's due to the other option not being enticing.

For example, Roadhog's Minor Hog Toss isn't picked very often compared to Scrap Hook. Other options like Ramattra's Void Surge is a cool perk to play with that increases the heroes damage, so it's much preferred over the simpler defensive option Prolonged Barrier.

Overall, the perk selection rates that are one-sided are the ones you would expect, and we're using these stats and feedback to identify which perks need to be either balanced or changed in future patches.

Brutalrogue99

> Are there any perks that you’ve seen a lot of praise for that you think you could potentially incorporate into the hero’s base kit?

Scott

There aren't any current plans to implement specific perks into hero kits, but there are perks that have helped heroes in ways that could lead to changes in the future.

I think the biggest example of this would be Bastion. The perks have helped fill in some of the holes in their kit. For example:

\- Armored Artillery making the ultimate more dynamic

\- Smart Bomb helping Bastion's lack of mobility

\- Self Repair aiding survivability issues (a resource limitation is coming in the midseason patch)

These perks have made the hero both better overall but much more fun to play as well. This was some of the major goals perks were trying to accomplish, but I can see us taking some parts of perks and putting them into base kits as heroes change in the future.

Scott

There are definitely some on the radar that we're keeping an eye on.

Obviously Tracer's Major perk Flashback was one that we were wary of and are looking to see how impactful this perk can be.

Mobility perks like Zarya's Minor Jump-Ups, this gives her a LOT of vertical mobility and is very strong on some maps, but its pick rate varies dramatically depending on the rank.

There is a list of perks that have been underperforming both in win and pick rate that we're actively looking at to make balance changes or even replace them starting in Season 16.

The goal is to make every set of Minor and Major perks feel like there is a choice to be made depending on your playstyle, the map, or how the match is going. If a perk feels like it's always the right choice or the wrong choice, then we want to make changes.

SuperSnivMatt

> Howdy! Wanted to ask how the team decides when to strictly buff an ability versus when to give it a drawback. Stuff like Sombra’s lockout duration increasing but decreasing her hack range by 30%, and Mercy’s Flash Heal being tied to Res where using Flash Heal means you can’t Res for 15 seconds, and using Res mean you can’t Flash Heal for 30. But then we see Tracer get all her blinks back on Recall as a massive boost despite no drawback like freezing her Blink CD or increasing her Recall CD. Do you see yourselves introducing drawbacks to more perks, or removing/reducing existing ones to shake up under/over preforming perks?

Scott

When first ideating on perks the team included more perks that had a strong benefit but a drawback. It was found that in some situations it could feel worse to play a perk even if the benefit was strong.

This can be seen currently with Sombra's Major, Stack Overflow. We wanted to give players an option to be able to increase the lockout duration to secure more kills, but reduce the range to make it riskier. We've received a lot of feedback that this perk doesn't feel good to use, or play against, so we're planning on making a balance change to help, and potentially replace it in the future.

We want to avoid situations like these in the future, and in the instance we do have a perk that has a drawback, we want to ensure that the other perk option doesn't also have a drawback so that there's always a beneficial option.

> Additionally, do you view perks as ""seasonal""? In which for example (extreme example) one season of Overwatch Mercy might lean into the damage boost aspect, whereas in future seasons for the purpose of changing things up, Mercy might even get a perk in which she can speed boost teammates instead? I think this could potentially be a pretty dramatic but fun way to change up the game and help some heroes to still be played but not conventionally fitting into certain compositions, but perhaps in your eyes it's a bit extreme for the purpose that Mercy's kit is supposed to serve?

Scott

Hey Jonny!

For the first round of perks we were focused on adding perks that enhance or change the way that you play heroes. In the future we could implement more transformative perks that would add skill expression, or change the style in which you would currently play a hero.

I wouldn't say that perks have ""seasonal"" themes in which they will be designed to play a hero a certain way, but we've learnt a lot about what perks are the most interesting and fun, while also seeing the impact that they can have on a heroes win/play rate.

Zakainu
> Now that perks are in players hands, what is your approach going to be moving forward when it comes to balancing and interating on them? Are you planning on radically changing perks in the future, and are you currently looking at adjusting the perks that are over/underperforming when it comes to pick rates?
> 
> In regards to Stadium, I'm very excited to try it. Can you shed some light on the regularity with which we can expect to see heroes added to Stadium? I would love to see what crazy upgrades you guys have in mind for Wrecking Ball.

Scott

For now the primary goal is to focus on adjusting the perks that are underperforming/overperforming. We will have a balance pass coming through in the Season 15 Midseason patch, and will be swapping out some perks that haven't been performing well in Season 16.

Pick and win rates are important factors in deciding what needs to be changed, but there is also a lot of great feedback we've received about perks that don't feel good to use or play against.

I wouldn't say there are radical changes to perks in the near future, but we will be working to ensure perks feel good to use for all heroes.

Bass-Slut

> Will changing perks mid game ever be an option?

Scott

We want it to feel like you're making a meaningful choice when you select your perk, and when allies/enemies select their perk you understand what to expect on that hero for the match.

We understand that there is an issue with people accidentally selecting a perk and being unable to change it, this is something we're keeping an eye on to see if there's something that can be done to help this.

I won't say that it will never be an option to swap your heroes perks in the future, but there are currently no plans to add changing perks mid game."

It's just my opinion and why this update isn't gonna make me return to the game, if anyone cares.

The perk system is really fun.

But the matchmaking is just as bad as ever. I am not talking about lopsided matches; I understand how there's a strong snowball effect for games in that genre. I am fine with it.

Tanks are still just raid boss making it so hard to try carrying compared to other roles.

But I have played about 30+ matches in comp and there's just always people (in either team) who absolutely don't belong in the rank there at, it's completely insane, almost every single match. I am talking about lucio with 1k heal who feed, cass who cannot shoot, genji who feed their brain out... and not just people who seem to have a tough game.

That's the reason I quit OW2 for MR in the first place, and it's just the same as before; probably even worse with resetting ranks again, just like why, are you really gonna do that every year now?

I know people criticize MR for its weird ranking system, but ultimately, it's very rare that I get someone so completely out of his league in a comp match and when that happens, you can at least still have a fighting chance by replacing that player in his role. Also, roles are so much more balanced.

Anyways, I guess I'll just get back to MR and check back next season the ban system."

Its the only real reason why i still care abour the game even if i barely play anymore 

However ive always felt that the hyper-mobile, one-shotting niche it filled during OW1 and the hyper-mobile disruptor niche it fills in OW2 aren't what we were promised. I hoped for him to be a combo based brawler, with a strong emphasis on ability ""spam"" rather than traditional FPS mechanics. His mobility and techs are beautiful, but its just not what i feel the character was MEANT to be.

So, here is what I dream of doomfist one day becoming.

I want his powerblock and rocket punch to have as low a cool down as posible. Dont know if we should make it a meter, or an extremely short one, or none at all.

The power block would be active essentially whenever you desire, since it really isnt that strong of a defensive move compared to every other tank. The meter fills like right now, and you may choose to instantly use that charge for a cone knockback with low damage or to store it to charge your fist. Every time to use power block, the meter refills, so you gotta be smart on how you use it since you cant stockpile it. 

I want uncharged fist to have low range. I want its range, damage and CC to increase according to your block. But when its not charged i want it to feel like a proper punch, not to tickle the enemy but launch them 40 miles. Again, since its going to be spammable, numbers should be tweaked. Nobody uses rocket punchs basic movement anyway, its always cancelled, so the loss on base movement isnt a problem.

I like his passive. It cements him as an ability centered, combo character. Its nice to have a tank with the ""damage = HP"" mechanic that isnt broken by design. Since power block is going to be available more often and fist can be spammed, it sould obviously be lowered.

His basic gameplay loop revolves around him leaping and interweaving small fists and shotgun shots to wittle enemy health. Whenever big damage comes bis way, power block helps keep him alive, with a potential reward of a beeg punche. His leap will be the only long cooldown, so it may be smart to save it as an escape tool once youve disrupted and brawled for a while.

I thought of this before the perks came out, and im yet to try how they play. But."

I left after season 3, and all this time, nothing interesting at all.

but, the new park system, hero bans, 6v6, and map voting is looking very interesting.

However, I still don't feel that good because it feels like they are innovating only because another game. the only new thing is the perk system. The rest is the long requested community features years ago. It feels like they are doing it for competition, not for players."

What I will say is that the recent changes and future direction of Overwatch 2 has won me back, I've been playing OW2 again and I've been loving it, not just the fact we can unlock good skins for free again, nor just the perk changes, it's everything. I haven't felt excited to play OW2 in years, and it's amazing to get that thrill again. I know there's a long ways to go before OW2 fully makes up for its missteps and mistakes, but I'm here hoping that it does make it there, and can pull itself fully back up from where it fell to one of the best hero shooters available.

"The perk system is perfect, it gives the Dev team the chance to combine all the lost OW1 and OW2 abilities into a single game.

Here's some examples:

**Roadhog**

His rework should be reverted. **E** is for healing, and his secondary fire is back in the game.

**Lvl2 Perks**

* Scrap Hook - Chain Hook hits reload two ammo.

* Invigorate - Take a Breather rapidly increases Roadhog's move speed by 30%.

**Lvl3 Perks**

* Pig Pen - Replace your secondary fire with a trap that can be placed on the floor and damages enemies.

* Hogdrogen Exposure - Take a Breather also heals nearby allies for 50% of its healing.

Now we can play with both original Roadhog, AND enjoy Pig Pen gameplay if we so desire!

**Doomfist**

**Lvl2 Perks**

* One-Two - Hitting an enemy with Rocket Punch reloads all Hand Cannon ammo.

* Seismic Empowerment - Hitting 3 or more enemies with Seismic Slam empowers Rocket Punch.

**Lvl3 Perks**

* Rising Uppercut - Power Block is replaced with Rising Uppercut!, allowing you to lift enemies into the air at a reduced damage.

* Power Matrix - Power Block absorbs projectiles for the first two seconds of its duration.

Now Doomfist can choose between empowering his Anchor Tank playstyle, or trade tankines for some extra mobility and CC thanks to his Rising Uppercut!

**Symettra**

**Lvl2 Perks**

* Advanced Teleportation - Teleporter cast range increased by 50%.

* Perfect Alignment - Primary Fire has a faster charge to max dmg.

**Lvl3 Perks**

* Shield Generator - Your Teleporter is replaced with a Shield Generator, granting 100 shields to allies in a wide range.

* Car Wash - Sentry Turret gains 3 extra charges.

Now Sym can choose between going back to her Shield Generator, finding better tactics for her turrets, or just choose a stronger W+M1 playstyle!

""*have a feeling they have a SHIIiieeeLLD generator somewhere...*"" - Junkrat.

Anyway, these are just a few examples to consider!, This game has SO MUCH potential right now! It's awesome!"

If team A  start with good rng,  while other is less good in rng .  The team A with better rng just continue to get strong due to perk because they die less.  To a point that even if teamB finally have good hero, they still unable to overcome the perk.  

I guess a good thing is that people learn not to die less but that encourage player to ran away in the middle of object taken/defending so they don’t die and lose the perk.

This seasons still young , maybe I’ll enjoy more.  But since I played around MH by myself, the 10 games I experience was not close and leave bad taste after it.  "
Feeling really bad about perks,Overwatch,79,1isu6mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1isu6mg/feeling_really_bad_about_perks/,95,2025-02-19 03:08:27,"I've been playing Overwatch since it's launch and, while I'm definitely never against trying something new, having *tried* the perks in a good handful of games now - I really don't like the new feel of the game.

One thing that made OW2 such a mess for a lot of fans was the changing of core mechanics (6v6 to 5v5 being the main example.) I don't understand why Blizzard thinks that overcomplicating the core gameplay like this is going to do anything but appease a handful of fans and completely alienate the others (especially those, like myself, who have learned and loved this game for years now.)

Perks add a level of unpredictability into the game which, while it would definitely be chaotic and fun for an arcade game mode, (in my opinion) should never have made it to quick play and definitely not comp. There's already so much to learn about Overwatch, especially with new heroes coming out every season. Now on top of that you have to remember perks, keep track of them by constantly looking at the scoreboard (taking attention away from the game), and try to calculate new cooldown times, ability usages, etc.

Not to mention many of the perks are so incomparable in usefulness. Some are cracked, some are borderline useless, and many completely alter the way the game and certain heroes play (to me, ruining the feel for the game that I've loved for so long.)

By adding perks into QP and comp (especially immediately, without some form of testing/grace period) one of my favourite games no longer feels like my favourite game. I can't opt out of perks unless I choose to play solely arcade, but with this change I simply can't play Overwatch 1 anymore.

That's my feelings on the matter, anyway. I'm interested to hear how other people feel because I've honestly seen a majority negative reaction (which makes me feel less crazy haha)"

Let’s be honest the never ending buffs and nerfs were never going to fix the game and make it what it once was, and adding a whole new layer to it won’t make it what it once was, but it’s different and that is refreshing in its own right.

Make your feedback clear about changes to the game (s15 - perk system),Overwatch,0,1iso2ma,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1iso2ma/make_your_feedback_clear_about_changes_to_the/,16,2025-02-18 22:21:04,"TL;DR: Perk system are bad change to try to gain attention from casual players and compete with MR, making the ow experience worse than it already was on top of the rest of the playerbase

  
\-----------------------------------==-----------------------------------//---------------------------------------

It is clear to me that the changes implemented were not even tested in the hacked quick mode or in any other type of laboratory and only served as a pretext to attract a ""new"" audience to the game to the detriment of everything that had been established and built until now to ""try to compete with MR"", as something ""new and fresh"".

It turns out that the perks system does not solve any of the giant problems that ow still presents to this day, which is the issue of balancing on a fine line, matchmaking and counterswap (the latter since the introduction of 5x5 and ow2), 

In fact, this system has only made the game's situation worse, the matches I enter are more stomp than ever, and it seems that all the problems of the recently bankrupt -paladins- are now ow's problems - I'm already seeing people ordering to change characters and come back because of not getting perk lv 2 x for a certain character (which is the ""goal""/meta one), the system (in addition to the ult) benefits even more the teams that are winning and the counter-swap on tanks has gotten worse, a buffed zarya is practically unstoppable even with the lv 2 perks of both her ""counters"" (rein/winston) and those she already countered (dva, orisa, Mauga, etc).

And it's good that you make your feedback clear, especially if it's negative, because if not, it will become commonplace for devs, just like S9 with the hitbox. dmg and health pool changes and 5v5 with ow2 that everyone swallowed in silence, even today they are considered bad patches for the game.

Anyway, bad change to try to gain attention from casual players,"

I think of perks as an example. Will they be perfectly balanced? No. Will they take time to settle? Yes. But at least we are doing these things which significantly shake up the game. 

They said the same about hero bans and map voting. 

There's so many reasons not to do something because you're worried about not doing it the perfect way but at this point in Overwatch's lifecycle I think having these significant shake ups is more important than striving for absolute perfection. 

Sometimes that means owning your mistakes, like what Aaron said about OW2 not being what was promised, or going back to old systems (i.e loot boxes, displayed ranks and even the 6v6 tests). 

I for one am extremely grateful for the mentality shift the OW team has taken in being way more proactive in taking risks and putting out fun stuff and it's amazing how that shift has restored some of that OG Overwatch feeling of excitement and anticipation. Let's make a great game! "
Finally excited about overwatch again.,Overwatch,4,1ipi994,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1ipi994/finally_excited_about_overwatch_again/,18,2025-02-14 20:08:00,"I'm someone who's played Overwatch since it released, wayyy back in the very beginning when we had barely half the characters we do now, and everything was radically different. And I'm also one of those people who constantly shit on 2 and say ""I miss overwatch 1"" and blah blah blah. Because I do, in my mind just about everything about OW1 was better. I'm not here to argue about that, it's just my opinion, not objective fact, so you're entitled to think otherwise just as I am. But it always just felt to me, like Overwatch 2 was a downgrade in every way. Worse in every way.

A certain other game came out recently, and I had fully quit Overwatch. Playing said game reminded me of how I felt playing Overwatch 1, I loved loved loved it, I still love it. I haven't stopped playing in the mere 2ish months its been out. I plan to continue playing it constantly. I had fully uninstalled Overwatch, and I thought I'd never do that. I was ready to say goodbye and just remember it fondly instead of engaging in a bastardized version of it that I hated.

So as someone who's a big Overwatch 1 fanboy, and a massive fan of that other game (I'm trying not to name it lol), and pretty much despised OW2, I have to say that everything they're adding has me excited. The perks look like such a fun way to mix the core game up and I can't wait to get my hands on it, but more than that. **Stadium?** That looks so much fun. I was watching Flats play it, and the moment he starts literally FLYING as Reinhardt I knew I had to play that mode, I know it won't come for a little while longer, but still. Even the new competitive weapons look neat, and I usually don't care about those, but the galaxy theme is so cool.

I probably will continue not to buy any skins if their prices don't get more reasonable. (Same with that one game I was alluding to, I've only bought battle passes, 22 dollars for a skin is just absurd.) but Perks, Stadium, and everything else we're getting soon, makes me actually excited and want to try the game again.

What's the community's consensus on all of this?"

>""Because people genuinely still don't understand how long it takes to develop major features and entire new game modes:

>Gavin Winter (Senior Systems Designer OW) on Emongg's stream mentioned that there's been a whole separate team dedicated to making the new Stadium mode for ***""a lot of the time""*** Gavin has been at Blizzard. For context, Gavin has been at Blizzard for nearly 4 years. He also mentions that gameplay engineers have been working on Stadium ***""for the past few years""***.

>Stadium having been worked on for 3 years lines up with the timeline of Hero Missions being publicly announced to be cancelled in May 16th 2023, with strong rumours that indicate Hero Missions were internally scrapped at least a year before that. Meaning that if developers were reassigned from Hero Missions to Stadium in early 2022; it has now been 3 years almost exactly to the day - lining up with the timeline Gavin alluded to in his comments.

>People also need to remember it's been nearly a year and a half since the Diablo collaboration when we first got to see some of the early testing of perks/skill trees in gameplay publicly. We just didn't know what project we were publicly testing for until now. It makes sense to reassign developers and convert the work done on PvE into something more in line with the true direction of OW which is PvP game play. Stadium is the result of that, taking the best parts from the old Hero Missions project and transforming it into something else that works better for the current game.

>All of this to say; development doesn't happen in 2 months. To the dismay of the far too many people that somehow think it does.""

>""Hero bans are basically confirmed to be a response to MR. Other than that, most of the features have been in the works for a while. OW2 has had a track record now of walking back bad initial decisions like bp locked heroes, but people will never give them credit for that even though things like that happened way before MR was even announced. In fact, there's good evidence to suggest the opposite where MR walked back their decision to paywall their own heroes because of the backlash in OW. Anyone who played MR beta saw the ""unlocked/locked"" hero tabs in the game that no longer exist after launch.""

On 3rd Person POV, Gavin said:

>""I know chat probably wouldn't believe this but we've been working on the 3rd Person thing for a long time... It's been something we've been working on for quite a while... It took a lot of work to get to this point and they're still not done working on it. When we first did 3rd Person quite a while back, the initial feedback was ""hard to aim"", so they've had to do so much work with the camera... *(\*inaudible)* the projectiles working well so there's a lot that going into trying to make it feels appropriate."""
"If Archives missions are never coming back, can devs allow players to remake them in Workshop?",Overwatch,0,1iottua,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1iottua/if_archives_missions_are_never_coming_back_can/,2,2025-02-13 22:17:23,"In the interview Aaron Keller had with Emongg, it was stated that the Overwatch Archives Missions wouldn’t be coming back. It was because they’d need to redesign them for the OW2 engine and it’s not worth their time to do that. I know a lot of people hated the modes but there were a lot who looked forward to playing them every year when they came back for a few weeks. 

So if the devs have no intention of doing it, can they let the players do it?

You can already do bot spawns in workshop for the zombie mode games (except I think for now it’s just the training range bots iirc), and a lot of the assets needed to make a PvE experience like opening doors and the different enemy types are already in OW2 from the Sojourn/Torb/Lucio PvE missions. The only thing that would be different is allowing the players to utilize voice lines from the archives missions in workshop. 

So could that happen? It’d be janky of course and it wouldn’t have the same 100% feel as the original archives missions. But I think a lot of people would appreciate option being made available in one way or another. Plus, players/workshop editors  could make new missions or even build on the old archives missions if they’re able to let the players choose perks or other mods. For all I know it’s been doable for some time now and the people who are proficient in workshop just haven’t made any codes for it. "

1 year ago i quited Overwatch 2.,Overwatch,0,1jgdnov,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jgdnov,15,2025-03-21 11:26:34,"Hey everyone, 1 year ago i quited Overwatch 2 because i didn't like the game anymore as how it used to be. Please note: i quited before Venture, Juno and Hazard we're released to the game. I wanted to ask/know your opinion if it's a good decision if i quited, of course before you say: it's your choice, your decision, de all feel sorry you quit, we feel sorry for the guy who shot himself in the foot, read this before responding, i quited for many various reasons: 

1 toxiticy.
In almost every type of game (comp/arcade/Qp) i got between 2-3 games slurred for whatever hero type i played, i played most tank heroes and was a GM5 before i quited.
And alots of players yelled at me with bad tank Hero, and more.

2: Overpriced and lazy skin designs
So many skins from OW1 got overpriced and Sells for over $20. Sorry but that's lazyness.

3: deletion of loot boxes and name cards,
Replaced it with battle pass. Only for Blizzard to do cash grab

4: cancelation of PVE, not once but three times in a row, where is all the time spend to??

5: the comp system.
When you win 3 games only like 20-40% progress? You lose, you lose 50% progress. C'mon for real??

6: the ridiculously abuse report system that gets you perma banned for whatsoever reason. And Blizzard support doesn't even look at your ticket appeal. I had to send 6 tickets to finnaly get a respond from a game master only to get ""isulted"" by them (watch photo with translation). According to Blizzard i was mocking and insulting people by saying CRY to them and Noob, some players even insult me?? I reporter them too and got the thank you report message. Even a warning on screen! In this game you can het mass reported and Blizzard claims it's not true, another lazyness from them. Proof the system is flawed.  

Throughout the years i played OW1 and OW2 i took countless screenshots of records of myself for improvement and players who were slurring, cursing and more....
Im showing here photo's of what happened between the year of 2023-2024 before i quited and what Blizzard did to me.

I promise you all photo's in here are taken from my PS4 console and are screenshots from between 2023-2024 from different type of matches before i quited.

My biggest questions are: if match/headsetchat isn't allowed then why does this game even have it?

Is saying (""CRY, Noob, lol, lmao, sit down) considered as a bannable offense? Throughout the years i played Overwatch i've seen this countless times and was never banned for it,  not even the pro players.

My last question: is it still worth to play OW2? Im still watching video's on YouTube  and the game cured my addiction of OW1, but in some cases i want to come back but im so afraid of losing my account that i spend so much time on with cosmetics, if made the account these nowadays i woulnd't mind/ care of getting banned, but now after that last 30 days ban for saying CRY to a toxic player and getting banned for just that, i dicided i didn't want to play anymore, you can't even defend yourself from any type of accusasion.

My biggest concerns with Stadium: queue times and longevity,Overwatch,2,1is00df,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1is00df/my_biggest_concerns_with_stadium_queue_times_and/,6,2025-02-18 01:48:59,"So IMO, Overwatch Stadium looks like, probably the second best thing Blizzard ever announced for Overwatch behind the cancelled PvE, and Stadium is actually locked in to launch in 2 months unlike PvE!

However, I have some grave concerns for its longevity, as we know, Stadium is going to be a permanent mode and an integral part of the OW2 ecosystem come season 16. A big reason for my concern is the fact it launches with only 14 heroes, a handful of maps, with promise of more coming gradually as time goes on.

We saw what happened to story missions, which are no longer released after the first 3 flopped financially and feedback-wise. which brings me to my next point, I guess Stadium itself sounds incredible on paper. it'll have endless variation and a hella lot more replayability than a handful of paywalled story-heavy, scripted quests. but i guess we wont find out until Season 16 if it'll stand the test of time and will be kept to speed with the base pvp experience from then onwards. especially we need to really see how good the mode is in our hands.

Coming to think of it, story, hero gauntlet and now hero mastery are all abandoned as of now. but they all have something in common, they were lackluster with not much replayability. if stadium can overcome these hurdles, it'll surely be here to stay right? which comes to another point i suggested in the title:

queue times. if Stadium is an absolute hit, there is still grave concerns for how long the honeymoon period lasts, and if people will genuinely stay interested. it is permanent after all. I guess Practice vs AI still has plenty of players in certain regions, but it has been also been all but abandoned. no clash, no new hero bots since mauga. which reminds me, workshop is abandoned and bugged.

i love overwatch 2 in its current state, don't get me wrong but i really want to be assured Stadium is here for the long haul. and that it remains a key part of what makes this game unique and special. who knows, it'll probably be so popular that base pvp will be shafted lol. it happened in other games.

The last concern i have is having a ranking system, which comp pisses me off constantly because of it. but i guess thats just a skill issue lol"

"Congratulations, Blizzard, you ruined Roadhog again.",Overwatch,0,1kfzozs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kfzozs/congratulations_blizzard_you_ruined_roadhog_again/,7,2025-05-06 10:49:59,"Now hold on a minute reddit, don’t crucify me just yet. I’m not gonna go ahead and claim that Roadhog is overpowered in a high-level competetive enviroment. That’s just not true, but I will explain why Hog has become such a pain in the ass in Quick Play again. Let me be clear, Hog has never been fun to deal with. Getting hooked never FEELS good, even before season 15. In the grand scheme of things however, he was manageable. His hook has always been extreme value for an ability with such a short cooldown. But it was balanced by the fact that literally every OTHER aspect of his kit was awful. He did no damage unless he had his full Hook+Pig Pen combo ready, could set up the pen, and his his hook. Since he lacked a shield, lacked mobility and had a huge hitbox, he sucked at keeping himself alive. As soon as he stepped out in the open he got ganked by the entire enemy team and denied.

What this meant is that he very rarely got a good chance to get great value for his hook because it was so easy to pressure him with damage or outright kill him. You saw Hog in maybe 1 of 20 matches, which made made him manageable. The first change they did was in the S15 mid season patch when they increased his HP by 50. Completely unescessary, but it didn’t really change anything.

The real change came with the launch of season 16. This added Hog’s infamous perk which gives him 50% overcharging Take a Breather charge just by triggering Pig Pen. Getting the charge is so easy that he effectively has a permament +50% charge. This means that literally any idiot can sustain through almost any teamfight, and as long as you can hit at least 25% of your hooks you’ll get absolute monster value. It’s so easy, and it’s so hard to die. Because playing as Hog is free value galore you now encounter him in maybe 50% of your quickplay games. He’s also a fairly common pick in ranked in gold and below, where most of the playerbase is situated. And man, as a tank main I am so very tired of fighting this invincible paint-huffer. Oh and I forgot to mention the perk which let’s him heal his allies around him. Making his team harder to kill was literally 50% of the reason people hated Prime Mauga and his stupid Cardiac Overdrive. So that was just an absolutely fantastic idea of Blizzard to add that to the game -\_-."

They all left because we were playing pretty well in just the first round mind you which was push on colosseo, so obviously not many powers and perks, but they leave by the middle of second round which was control.

Why don't more people want Rein's shield needs a buff?,Overwatch,0,1k7ua9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k7ua9y/why_dont_more_people_want_reins_shield_needs_a/,22,2025-04-25 21:57:37,"Edit: \*THINK\* Rein's shield needs a buff, typo is my bad.

Because I think it does. Rein's shield was initially 2000 points, but it was reduced to 1500 a long time ago. But thing is, this was back in OW 1. When two tanks were guaranteed on every match. And this back when Orisa had a shield (not counting perks now). Which meant double shields was a thing you ran into often.  So it made more sense.

But now? Rein is often the only tank on your team, and his shield doesn't have the staying power to protect a team for long. Ask around on this subreddit and you'll be told that Rein's shield should be used selfishly, and that is correct, *but it shouldn't be*.

Rein's shield is so big, and  his line is 'Get behind me! *I am your shield!* His presence on the field is also so large that he is basically the first thing most people target. Meaning 1500 can get wittled down QUICK\*\*,\*\* which then takes quite a long time for it to come back (at least long for how quickly a fight can last.)

Oh, and also Blizzard removed his best perk, the one that allowed him to recharge his shield with firestrike.

As someone who has recently found that Rein is my fav tank, I really don't understand why his shield and all around survivability is so low for the guy who is *supposed*  to be the big bullet spunge who can't move worth a shit but makes up for it pure defence?"
How are we feeling about the stadium characters right now?,Overwatch,3,1k6zt5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k6zt5x/how_are_we_feeling_about_the_stadium_characters/,12,2025-04-24 20:38:28,"[My general opinion on standings rn](https://preview.redd.it/aqy2n3idptwe1.png?width=583&format=png&auto=webp&s=55cb7323153288c184aa1d07782142dc91af6bc5)

Personally I think most characters are at minimum decent, but I think some when compared to the others in the mode are just not as equipped for stadium.

S- The best  
\-Rein, he can do it all, run in and swing his hammer, be a super tank, throw huge fireballs, play more supportive, imo the BEST designed character in the mode.  
\-Orisa, Very very tanky, with a few different options in how to play be it with barrier and overheat cooling down faster, or just flat super tanky stats. She can brawl really well.  
\-Cassidy, lots of bullets, he can break barriers and if you give him more bullets he will proceed to wall up to a squishy and delete your IP with over 30 bullets crammed into his revolver. Very good.  
\-Soldier, aim hacks are good, aoe is good, self sustain is good, mobility is good. He can fight head on or flank and is a menace.  
\-Juno, Torpedoes with ap CHUNK, and can hit the whole enemy team, and reset, and you can have more than one, AND heal your team at the same time. Easily the strongest support rn.  
\-Kiriko just does a lot of damage, healing, and is pretty safe and protects you with suzu. That will always be good.

A- The very good  
\-Zarya, bigger bubbles are great for BEING the barrier, and with other ways to be more supportive with your bubbles you can super tank while not investing in damage and STILL do damage. She's great.  
\-Reaper, he can either run at your frontline or tp in and shred your back line and he cant reset on kills, it's very strong but cc can really mess him up and he can get bursted really quick for doing it against teams that are prepared. Very strong.  
\-Mei, the mini tank, flanking menace to society. Having a second tank that does damage is pretty good especially with stronger zoning with the blizzard wall.  
\-Lucio, has a few build, is probably the most fun support. He can run speed boost more and swap back to heal for bigger bursts allowing him to stall longer and rush his team in more aggressively. Beyond this on certain maps he can really get oppressive with double boops, and the residual crossfade effects are great, not to mention mini sound barriers. Very nice, very fun, clip that shit.  
\-Ana, anti nade will always be strong, and Ana can do A LOT of damage if she specks into it and has a lot of utility. That said tight maps means there are a lot of moments you'll lose line of sight so she isn't perfect, but she's very good if you can aim and can take down Juno and other menaces.  
\-Moira, 1 ball was oppressive, 4 balls is pure madness, and combine that with increasing her damage and Moira is a DPS healer.

B- The Good  
\-DVA, very annoying to deal with, good harass, pretty safe with going in and out, but does struggle a bit with Mei and Zarya being present even with the perk to beat beams. That said, bomb is pretty useful on a lot of maps and she can bully remove healers and knock people around. Solid but offers much less compared to a Rein or Zarya.  
\-Genji, very much more of what Genji already does, flank, harass, dash, reset. You can go for more Shurikens, stronger blade, or more I frames on dash, but generally I'd rather have Soldier or Reaper than Genji.  
\-Ashe, very hit or miss. Bob is always useful, but ultimately a lot of the fire perks and AP Ashe just feels like a trap and she's very easy to dive and kill. Generally speaking in my experience Ashe's who can hit headshots will outperform triple dynamite mini bob Ashes 9 times out of 10. Maybe when more people learn how to build she'll seem better, but right now she's a plain skill check for the person playing her which I can't really say about Cowboy with his spammy fun hijinks.

C- Okay  
\-Mercy, she is essentially just normal Mercy. A lot of her powers feel mediocre or very situational, and you don't really seem to benefit much from AP unless you're building very specific AP scaling perks and items as her staff and gun seem to scale with AD. Don't know the exact ratios of how things actually effect her staff, but honestly she is just a skill check on the Mercy player and the enemy team. If they aim at you, you will die and be useless without help, if they don't you get to freely fly about and heal for 4-9k a round. I really feel she is probably the worst in terms of execution as no perk is really exciting to use.

D- No.  
\-Junker Queen. I have heard tales of the unkillable monster Queen, but have never seen this. Kiri, Ana, Orisa, Rein all bully the crap out of queen and I've yet to see a Queen win where it was because of the queen and not a DPS hard carrying while Queen just kinda exists. Some of her powers are cool, and some are cool only in concept not execution, like the leaping carnage is REALLY mediocre and basically a tiny hop. Shout reset build is fine, but again Kiri exists and people can build to punish having a huge amount of HP so I feel Queen just isn't there. Would love to see the leap perk actually turn into a special effect with a bigger jump and a slam or something to actually make queen be more disruptive and impactful because right now she just gets bounced around in my experience.

Returning to a match after a DC completely resets your progress,Overwatch,0,1k2b95l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k2b95l/returning_to_a_match_after_a_dc_completely_resets/,2,2025-04-18 19:58:00,"I've noticed an issue that’s been around for a while, and I feel like it deserves some attention.

When a player disconnects mid-match and manages to rejoin, all progress is wiped. Ult charge resets to 0, personal stats disappear, and with the new Perks system, those are gone too and have to earn from the ground up. You have to earn everything again from scratch, as if you just loaded into a fresh match.

It’s especially rough in ranked games, where every bit of progress matters. And in most cases, the disconnect isn’t even the player’s fault, it could be a minor internet hiccup or a crash.

To make things worse, rejoining often comes with a noticeable FPS drop, which makes finishing the match frustrating and difficult to play properly.

It would be great to see Blizzard address this. Even something simple like retaining ult charge or previously earned perks would make a big difference."
Do we really need hero bans?,Overwatch,0,1k0qq8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k0qq8b/do_we_really_need_hero_bans/,40,2025-04-16 19:51:05,"Ever since Blizz announced we're getting hero bans the discussion seems to revolve around which heroes will never see the light of day again in comp. The the top 2 reasons most people use (rightfully) for which heroes they'll ban the most are: 1, they make the whole lobby miserable and 2, they make playing their hero miserable.  
  
My thing is, aren't those two things that we should solve through balance patches? We've heard by now the endless complains of how horrible it feels to play tank into Ana, support into Sombra, anything into Widow and the sentiment the community seems to have around these heroes is ""ban them until Blizzard has no choice but to rework them"". So then, why do we need to do all that before potential reworks happen? Just get to it now. I'm sure Zarya will sit pretty in DVa players' ban lists and so will Torb in Tracer players' lists but instead of entirely removing a hero counter from the hero pool, why don't we work in softening hard counters? Tough to do through balance patches alone without overcomplicating things but since we have perks now, isn't that the perfect opportunity to add more options for heroes to deal with their counters better? We're already seeing some stuff like Ashe's minor perks giving her ways to deal with divers and flankers better or one of Doom's major perks allowing him to absorb projectiles (including sleep darts for example), so there's potential for more there.  
  
On top of it, with certain heroes potentially rarely being seen, what will happen is metas will shift from game to game. What do we do about Mauga when Ana isn't an option? Guess we now balance Mauga around the fact that Ana is banned most of the time? What if Ana gets through but Kiri got the ban hammer this game so you have no choice but to eat nades until you're sick of it? As an Echo player, I will see less of some heroes I'm not huge on playing against like Sombra, Widow or Zarya because they're probable top bans most games. That's an indirect buff to a character that has potential to really annoy people if they're not getting checked. Point is, even if the most annoying characters in the game will be banned often, there's room for others to take their place as a result of this system.  
  
Then there's the malicious banning aspect. If I hate playing with Ball players because I just want a meaty tank with a meaty shield in front of me evey game and not the backline terrorist hamster, what's stopping me from banning the character just because of that? One of the most overhated heroes, Mercy, will only get banned because people dislike having Mercy players in their team, that's it. Well, you're not banning the Mercy player, you're just banning their best hero.  
  
A lot of Mercy players, just like Doom, Ball, Lucio, etc. are one-tricks, so if their characters are banned, it will be a long day for everyone. ""Just don't one-trick, idiot. Problem solved."" There are plenty of people making it to the high ends of the ladder on one character alone and that's what they enjoy the most, anyway. How many games in a row of not getting to play their main will Sombra players be able to take until they decide comp (or Overwatch) isn't for them anymore? Do we really need more disgruntled players?  
  
There's good that can come from hero bans. Some people will have more fun on average even if others will suffer for it but there's potential for more variety in the game, more niche heroes getting their turn and that's nice. But maybe there's other ways to get there without introducing even more reasons for people to fight over how Overwatch should and shouldn't be. I'm all for change when it moves the game forward and innovates it but a hero ban system feels more like chipping away at a core aspect of Overwatch (counter-picking) at best and creating way bigger headaches down the line at worst.

So, anyway, I'm banning Zarya every game starting next season :D"

My honest take on Venture,Overwatch,0,1jwnpob,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1jwnpob/my_honest_take_on_venture/,45,2025-04-11 13:37:44,"A bit of context : I've been a Venture main aince her release, trying to climb the ranks as a Venture OTP (One Trick Player). It doesn't work out that much, so I've been resorting to Soj when I'm clearly outmatched. Mind you, I started my journey mid Bronze (jumping between Bronze 2 and 3) and steadily climbing to whre I am now, wich is low to mid Plat (around 60 to 80% Plat 4)

So here's my opinion : she is outclassed everywhere by othere characters. As a dive hero, she as a lot of potential. The combination of Burrow and Drill Dash as abilities makes it so she can go pretty much anywhere and get out as soon as things get a little bit heated, or that's what you would think...

Lets be honest here, Burrow, as an escape tool, is bad. Unlike other ""Oh sh**"" buttons, like Reaper's Wraith Form or Tracer's Recall, there is a wind-up time and GOD DOES IT LAST LONG! Between the moment the button is clicked and the moment you are safe underground, around a second as passed and god know how easy it is to be canceled; Hook, hinder, stun, even hack. So, in order to be safe even after it's been canceled, you need to be starting it even before the fight as started, and we all know that's just not possible. 

Next, Drill Dash. How to say this... Simply put, it's... actually not bad. From my personal experience, it is one of, if not the most versatile ability in the game. It does good damage, has a good range and moves ennemies. Overall, it is a really well balanced tool, with only an 8 second cooldown. The only issue I have with it is it's lack of CC (Crowd Control, AKA, stuns and sh**). Don't get me wrong, I am not saying ""Give that thing the ability to cancel everything with 8 seconds of down time"", but at least make it so that ennemies in the drill can't attack, cause right now, I could get hindered while drilling him, and no one wants that.

Following that, her overall state is weird. I would want to talk about skins, but... Yeah, 3 skins is all we have; 1 epic from drops and 2 legendaries: 1 from shops and 1 from battlepass. THAT'S EVERYTHING. Even Freja, who isn't even out yet, has more skin concepts then Venture as official skins. Then again, I really feel like Blizzard just doesn't want to admit she exists. 

Finally, her pick opportunity. As a Venture main, I feel like she can work in any comp and situation. She has the range for poke, the AOE for brawl and the mobility for divs. The issue is that she isn't that good in any one of them. She doesn't have that big of a range, even with her perk, she has not that much HP so dies quickly and doesn't have a big burst damage. She is easily outclassed by other characters like Sojourn, Mei or Tracer in those situations. And don't get me strated on counters. She can't kill tanks, any flying characters are out of reach, characters with ""oh sh**"" buttons are just not a viable option, CC characters are out of the equation and I'm probably missing something. So, what is there left? Only a handful of heros: Ana, Lifeweaver, Bap(if you have a good team), Ash, Widow, Hanzo, Bastion but that's it. 

So yeah. Thank you for reading this. Turned out to be more a rant then what I wanted originally, but still, thank you. I am curious to see what you think about her and I will be reading comments (and probably answering)
Once again, thank you
Rasta

Edit : I completely forgot to mention the ult. WHY DID WE GET SCAMMED THIS MUCH??? Venture's ult requires you to be on the ground to be used. Logical, right? Should work the same as every ground ult like Junk's RIPTire or Rein's Big Slam, am I wrong? Nope, it's in a class of it's own. Doesn't go up the stairs, gets stopped at the slightest elevation and DOESN'T WORK IN ZARYA'S BLACK HOLE!!! SDJFNAOHDOIEIUCHAK WHY??? TT"
How do new players feel about Overwatch 2?,Overwatch,2,1jpivw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1jpivw3/how_do_new_players_feel_about_overwatch_2/,10,2025-04-02 09:25:27,"Hey guys,

my opinions about Overwatch changed many times in the past years. I think I don‘t have to explain why, you guys saw what blizzard did to this franchise. Now, after they added perks, i’m pretty optimistic.

I just want to know how new players (who aren‘t aware of these problems in overwatch and dont care about them but just playing the game) feel about the game now. Do you enjoy it as a casual?"
My Issue with perk selection and a possible Solution,Overwatch,0,1jmgz7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1jmgz7d/my_issue_with_perk_selection_and_a_possible/,3,2025-03-29 08:23:09,"DISCLAIMER: I am not sure if that‘s already been suggested or if Blizzard addressed this issue.

In the heat of battle, it’s easy to select the wrong perk, even if it doesn’t happen often. The fast-paced nature of the game demands full attention, making it sometimes difficult to double-check perk choices. Sometimes, I misclick or forget whether I’ve reached level 2 or 3, leading to incorrect selections.

While one could argue that perks should and could be chosen while respawning rather than mid-fight, that’s not always practical, at least for me. Some perks, like increased projectile launcher speed (Rat) are highly effective in combat, making mid-battle selections necessary. Even when respawning and rushing back, especially in crucial moments like overtime, the focus is on reaching the objective, not carefully analyzing perk icons.

Accidentally choosing the wrong perk can completely throw off a player’s strategy. For example, selecting a trap perk instead of a nitro boost can drastically change my approach with tire (e. g. not being able to take out a support in a more effective way), which can be the difference between securing or losing a team fight or even the game.

Suggestion for Improvement:

To reduce misclicks and improve clarity, I suggest giving each perk level a distinct color:

MINOR perks: Keep white and black icons. MAJOR perks: Use red or another distinct color.

Currently, all perk icons look too similar, making it difficult to differentiate them in fast-paced situations. A clearer visual distinction would help prevent accidental selections, allowing players to execute their intended strategy without unnecessary mistakes.

What do you guys think?"
"A problematic meta has emerged in the metal ranks, and possibly the higher ones as well",Overwatch,0,1ji366c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1ji366c/a_problematic_meta_has_emerged_in_the_metal_ranks/,11,2025-03-23 17:27:57,"The last two weeks, and especially since the mid-season patch, a certain 4 hero lineup has emerged as having excessively strong synergy, especially once perks come online. This lineup is:
- Zarya
- Genji
- Sojourn
- Ana

What you have in this group is four individually strong heroes once perks come up (especially Sojourn and Ana) who are all built to enable and cover the weaknesses of Genji. Genji goes from a strong but fair on his own with perks, to utterly and completely unanswerable in this lineup.

Add Brigitte to the mix to help enable Genji and Soj from afar with her buffed repair packs while babysitting Ana and it becomes a complete deathball.

At the core of the strength of this four (or five man) lineup is one particular perk synergy: Zar’s spotter+Genji’s thirst+Genji’s meditation. Zar’s range enablement and Genji’s self healing allows him to function as a miniature doomfist in what I can only describe as Ninja Goats.

Once nanoblade is online, this perk synergy turns an already fight winning ult combo into an uncounterable one. You can’t interact with Genji in bubble, he moves faster, he’s lifestealing while swinging, and if you do burst through bubble he has meditation to momentarily sustain before continuing the onslaught while potentially receiving a second bubble in Zar’s cooldown cycle.

On top of all of this, you’ll have to contend with 2  of Grav, Overclock, and Rally in the next team fight so this lineup will always feel like its winning ult economy-wise.

Fundamentally, I think this game is in a good place meta-wise when high skill cap heroes like genji are good, but you have to allow skillful counterplay against that strength… and Zar’s excessively good enablement in her current iteration server admins and doesn’t let you interact with the ninja murdering your backline.

Plus the obvious Ana and Soj just being fundamentally overpowered right now with perks…

We have to nerf these heroes/synergies Blizzard, we have to."

Several comments pointed to her ""safe"" design and kit, which I don't think is a fair thing to say before we get a chance to play her. Especially with her unique mobility, we all know how many subtle nuances can hide deep within a kit like that.

OW1 trailed at the end with the infamous content drought, but I think Freja's lack of attention is a symptom of the exact opposite - **content flood.** 

I mean, just look at everything that's happened in that last few months. Perks, Stadium reveal and streamer test, Freja reveal and streamer test, LLE SERAFIM collab, 6v6 test, Perks again after a huge patch.

And to emphasize the perks, most of them offer fundamental changes to how a hero plays so it's like we're rediscovering each of these heroes, and then had to do so yet again at the big patch on the 18th.

And the 6v6 tests have caused many big streamers to give the game a try again so twitch and youtube enjoyers have a proper deluge of content to catch up on there, not to mention OWCS dropping some BANGER matches the last few weeks, and like 4 rounds of Twitch drops both for general OW and OWCS cosmetics. For those of us who get really into the nitty-gritty parts of the scene, there's a HUGE abundance of dev interviews to claw through.

And then we follow all that up with a Freja Story trailer AND comic reading yesterday and it's like... that's so great. I have no bad feelings about that. But... let me go grab a power-nap first lol

Truly, I kinda gave myself a headache listing everything out, cause it's just so much to love all at once, and we're barely getting started. Stadium drops in a month (or perhaps mid season 16, I'm not sure) and it's poised to be the most fascinating, and highest-effort thing Blizzard has done so far. Honestly even bigger than a new hero.

Freja is great. I love Freja's kit and her design has a lot of cool things going for it. It's just that she's standing next to a MOUNTAIN of similarly-cool shit. There's no lack of hype. But there are way more places to put our hype than we're used too!

The quality of games are going to be awful until Blizzard does something big to get people to play again. The matches were good while everyone was having fun with the perk system but the honeymoon phase is over and a lot people got bored/hate Overwatch again.   
  
The less people that play -> the harder it is to make matches with equal skill levels -> the more time in queue -> the wider the skill levels are (mmr range) on each team.   
Their systems engineer even said that the more time in queue you wait the less restrictions they put on making your match.

My confession,Overwatch,144,1j861b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1j861b6/my_confession/,5,2025-03-10 19:44:23,"My name is Winton Hartwell Overwat. I live at 123 Amarillo Banana Lane, Watchpoint Gibraltar, Spain, 69420. This is my obsession. If you’re playing this game, you probably have no bitches. Blizzard has been building a PC gaming empire for many years now and has been using OW as its esports flagship. Shortly after OW’s seventh year anniversary, Bobby Kotick came to Team 4 with a rather shocking proposition. He asked that they use their gaming knowledge to cook up a F2P model for their game, which he would then use to sell Kiriko skins to gooners. Gooners with seemingly infinite money. 

I was… astounded, I… I always thought that Blizzard was a company that put players first and I was… thrown, confused, but the fans were particularly starved for content at the time, something they knew and took advantage of. They were reeling from a sexual assault lawsuit that was poised to bankrupt the company. Bobby made Team 4 play Fortnite and showed them just how much money even a non-predatory F2P game could make. And they were weak. They didn’t want their company to go into financial ruin so they agreed. 

Every day I think back to that moment with regret. Team 4 quickly realized they were in way over their heads, and Bobby had a partner, a man named Armin Zerza, a businessman. Bobby essentially sold the dev team into servitude to this man, and when they tried to quit, Zerza threatened financial recourse. They didn’t know where to turn. 

Eventually, Bobby and the female Blizzard staff had a falling out. From what I can gather, Bobby was always pushing for a greater share of the breast milk, to which the female staff flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. The state of California was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a “civil rights lawsuit” on the corporation, which succeeded, and Blizzard’s reputation was seriously injured, and they wound up paying restitutions which amounted to a little over $54 million. 

Upon recovery, Bobby was bent on recouping their losses, working with a man named Aaron Keller, he plotted to kill Overwatch League, and did so. In fact, the league that he killed was devised by Bobby himself, and he gave the teams no option in it. 

I have often contemplated quitting the game, but I am a coward. I wanted to go touch grass, but I was frightened. Overwatch had risen in the ranks to become the top hero shooter, and about that time, to keep the game fresh, they took the sixth teammate away from players. For 2 years they kept it 5v5. My duo, who up to that point, had no idea of my toxic team chat activities, was horrified to learn what slurs I used, why I got banned for two weeks. 

We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated Blizzard for what they had done to my team-based hero shooter. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, they gave us perks. I can’t take this anymore. I live in fear the day that Overwatch will perma-ban me, or worse, stop making Kiriko skins. I… all I could think to do was to make this reddit post in hope that the world will finally see this monke, for what he really is."

Perks blocking my mouse during games,Overwatch,0,1j6ra71,https://v.redd.it/6ka71utv8jne1,21,2025-03-08 22:20:19,"Had this for a while and thought it could be my laptop's fault but I checked absolutely everything, even contacted the blizzard support... and found nothing that could help.
The season 15 is making me cry. Perks are cool, but only if I could actually play when I have them.
Managed to record this yesterday while playing Mercy (that's the only one I can actually play without being scared of not being able to move in the middle of a game, had to use Valk randomly to be helpful, that was terrible), but actually happens with any other hero in general. For example happened during a 1v1 against a Widow and my forehead paid the price later.

 When I get a perk, my mouse instantly starts missing pixels and nothing works, can't aim correctly, can barely look around. As you can see it immediately happens as soon as I get the perk. Then, when I take one... it's going back to normal. Most of the time I try to take the perk as quick as I can but sometimes, especially in comp, I can't allow myself to stop randomly to take it.
My mouse is all good, it never happens in other games and sometimes it doesn't even happen. But when it does, it's always about perks.
 So I'd like to know, since Blizzard can't actually answer, if anyone is also facing this problem and eventually found a solution, I would love to hear it because it's actually ruining my games. I know touching grass wouldn't hurt me but hey still...

 Thank you a lot, will really appreciate any help because I really don't know what to do :/"
"MH became a problem with perks, but this patch is not the solution",Overwatch,0,1j3jom8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1j3jom8/mh_became_a_problem_with_perks_but_this_patch_is/,12,2025-03-04 20:47:58,"Before this patch MH became even more imbalanced with perks, as whoever won the first team fight would likely win the game. Not only did you get to keep your ult that was built up and the losing team didn't, but you also got to keep your perk XP and the losing team didn't.

Blizzard's solution: MH now auto-gives you two perks at random when you start on a hero.

This just feels awful. You'd have to stop and check the icons you have and...what? Consult a wiki?

MH just keeps getting treated like garbage and it's really frustrating from my perspective as someone who almost only plays MH. First they got rid of comp MH, then they deleted role queue MH from existence. Now this. It's just jarring change after jarring change with nothing mentioned in patch notes.

My proposed solution: As a long time MH player I would very much recommend that normal perk choices come back and RQ MH returns:

1) The roles keep things like 3 Roadhogs/2 Mercys from happening which is usually a game over.
2) Dying means the pool of heroes you come back as is lessened, making the perk XP you've earned more likely to see the light of day again with your chances of seeing that hero again being increased.
3) You don't need a Rolodex to figure out what perk you've been auto-given, as it is currently.

I love this game, and especially MH. Always have. I wish Blizzard cared about it too, because it sure doesn't feel like it over the years.. And I know most of the community doesn't care about the game mode, but I'm hoping if you've read this far it means that my solution makes sense, or at the very least it seems like Blizzard is just...so weird with MH decisions.

Edit: What started this post is that  there are perks that don't work for everyone, and some that are objectively terrible in comparison to the other option. I don't like being given the Tracer perk that isn't reset-all-blinks, or the manual fire Cassidy perk. And I can't imagine anyone likes figuring out they have these perks mid fight because checking the perk details on console is such a clunky chore (from what I'm being told there's just a key to check there on PC)"

You queue up for a PvE match as one of the 3 roles, once you join a match, a random map is selected like normal, along with the objectives and enemies etc. In 2021 Blizzcon, they showed what they were working on, somewhere in Blizzard should have the scrapped ideas, or parts of it coded/programmed still. (I'm not sure, I'm not a programmer/game designer).

  
The enemies are already implemented in the Invasion, perks/talents are up and coming this season and the next one, they could add more as the updates come and editing maps is seemingly easy or average to make (or they don’t have to edit the maps) what’s stopping them from making it happen?

No matter how one-sided the first round was, the next round is a clean slate. It was the only game mode with a true clean slate between rounds/points. Payload resets between rounds, but the outcome of round 1 moves the goal posts of round 2. Flashpoint is similar to KOTH with the neutral capture points but it doesn't have the clean reset between points.

It's not that common for it to noticeably affect an outcome of a match, but sometimes it's a big deal (like if one ana has double nano because of 1st map's snowball, but the other ana doesn't have double nano by the time she charges ult in round 2).

Idk I think it's along the lines of blizzard's talk about hero fantasy/identity. They don't wanna change the core identity of a hero in reworks. They've kinda messed with the core identity of KOTH in a bad way, imo. If KOTH rounds don't last long enough on average to get major perks, they could make perks charge faster in KOTH and make them reset each round."

So, why not combine the two? What if you were playing Thor Reinhard and you start off with the Level 1 skin, get the level 2 skin after the minor perk, and then final level after the major perk? 

Personally, the best way to do this I think is to allow players to set what they want their their Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 skins to be. 

Fake edit: You know, while writing this, I figure why restrict this specifically to mythics (well, probably because that adds more sales value to Blizzard, but ignoring that...) maybe it'd be cool to assign skins to all characters, and have them upgrade as they match goes on. It would add more value to all skins since you don't just see one skin the whole match but 3. "

The inconsistencies between heroes, both in minor and major ones, are laughable. While Zarya turns into a killing machine and Tracer can blink 50 times a minute, Genji just regenerates a tiny bit (not to mention the perk that resets his double jump, which already resets when he touches the ground).

Don't get me wrong, it's nice to see some changes, but this feels like yet another poorly thought-out dive into deep water. For every perk that gives you a double slide, there's one that gives enemies lifesteal, and this supposedly ""faster"" gameplay doesn’t really feel that way.

From what I’ve observed, the further we go into new competitive games, the more developers tend to speed up the gameplay. Players demand it, sure, but couldn't Blizzard have gone further? Couldn’t this new system actually introduce *new* mechanics instead of just recycling old ones? Are they leaning more toward ""old"" fans who begged for Orisa’s shield to return or for nostalgic stimulation with Reaper’s original healing orbs?

Where a perk could offer more freedom to shape the playstyle players dream of, we just get the same gameplay, only *more*.

The fact that some characters last abilities are gatekept by perks is pretty astounding (Bastion and Reaper),Overwatch,0,1iv68ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1iv68ft/the_fact_that_some_characters_last_abilities_are/,3,2025-02-22 01:25:10,"Like shouldn’t every character just… have all of their abilities and then perks change those abilities in whatever way. If bastion had self repair (on a resource meter) and reaper had his death volley their major perks instead could change them in whatever way, maybe increasing death volley range or increasing self repairs resource meter or something like that.

It just feels like: “Oh yes my major perk. Now, do I want to do something fun or do I want to play a completed character.”

Like imagine Winston’s secondary fire was a perk not an ability, not everyone would pick it and the character would just be straight up missing an ability.

Personally, I’m hoping they just alter and add in these perks as abilities, given the fact they’re perks shows that Blizzard CAN add them in, and add some more intricacies into their major perks instead of the aforementioned “perk or ability”.

With these characters in particular, reapers other major perk is crazy good with the additional lifesteal upon exiting wraith and bastions cannon is situational but fun, if people want to pick those perks I don’t think it’s fair that they’re playing an unfinished character.

Wishing that in mid season they add in these abilities."
perks didnt fix the game,Overwatch,0,1iuncnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1iuncnk/perks_didnt_fix_the_game/,16,2025-02-21 10:54:03,"im not here to say you arent allowed to have fun with overwatch. just getting that out of the way

  
i keep seeing people who are loving the perks, and yeah, its fun. it added a TON of flavor to the game. but in my personal opinion, flavor isnt enough. the perks havent fixed \*\*\*ANY\*\*\* of the underlying issues that has driven so many players away to begin with.

tank still feels absolutley horrible to play

orisa is still a plague on the game

mercy still has a beam length the size of canada and gets INSANE VALUE for doing the bare minimum (existing in the game)

teamates are still rude and obnoxious, plus i get people baby raging every other game

widow still is a server admin.

and losses still feel absolutley horrible while wins feel like a fluke

  
i want to love the game again. and i was hoping that this was the spark it needed to finally get it back. but as soon as all the hype dies down its all going to shit again.

the worst part is they CANT or WONT change those things that are ruining the game

tank still feels horrible because theres only 1, and they wont change that because they would have to admit they were wrong and make massive balance changes across the board

orisa is still a plague because they see a 49% winrate and think she needs a 5 damage buff to her gun

they cant nerf mercy because they would lose half the playerbase

they cant do anything about the toxicity because thats just the kind of audience overwatch has gathered

widow is a server admin because they cant remove her 1 shot without damn near scrapping the entire character and starting over

and matches feel horrible because no matter how good you \*are\* doing, it will always feel like you are doing bad, which only gets worse with toxic teamates

  
again, i love overwatch and want it to do better. and i DO have fun when i play it... once a week. any more than that and i feel \*dirty\* and icky after each game. and as much as i love the perks, i wish blizzard would listen to their community complaints more. it shouldnt need 200k+ people constantly complaining for 6 months to get something changed.

perks are a baindaid fix, a sparkly bandaid but a bandaid none the less. and the wound is infected with gangrene. a bandaid might cover it up but its not solving anything and the issues are just getting worse in the meantime"

After reaching perk level 3, blizzard could add a 4th level that allows the player to be able to switch between 2 ultimates at will; current hero ults and a brand new one for each hero.

-Ult charge rates 
-Losing ability to counter ultimates, such as Rein v Rein blocking shatter 
-too in-depth for new players

Overwatch2 Has a Serious Balance Problem Right Now,Overwatch,0,1issipd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1issipd/overwatch2_has_a_serious_balance_problem_right_now/,5,2025-02-19 01:52:11,"Over multiple seasons, DPS heroes—especially hitscan characters—have been excessively nerfed, while relatively easy-to-play support heroes have consistently received buffs. As a result, support players have been able to climb to higher ranks with less effort, and this has been a long-standing frustration for me. At this point, I don’t feel like DPS heroes have any significant advantages over support heroes, whether in terms of damage output or survivability.

Now, with the introduction of Perks in Season 15, the imbalance has only gotten worse. DPS Perks provide little to no direct damage increase, even if there are any, they often come with conditions or debuffs. Meanwhile, support Perks overwhelmingly provide straightforward buffs to their abilities, with no drawbacks. Not only that, but the power creep on some of these support Perks is outright ridiculous.

For example, Ashe's Perk increases her fire speed but lowers her damage, and she must land consecutive snipe shots to get additional damage. Meanwhile, Ana’s nade simply doubles in radius by simply pressing a single button, and she can apply nanoboost to both herself and an ally that gives her insane survivability and damage potential in a teamfight with zero risk. Does this sound like a fair patch?

Updates like this drastically reduce the appeal of playing DPS, which in turn weakens the identity of Overwatch as an aim-based FPS game. Why does Blizzard keep buffing easy-to-play roles and heroes while neglecting or nerfing mechanically demanding ones? At this rate, I genuinely wonder if their end goal is to make Overwatch a 5v5 game where only support players remain, because that’s exactly where we’re headed."

Sombra and Doomfist Rework ideas,Overwatch,0,1iqjgit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1iqjgit/sombra_and_doomfist_rework_ideas/,1,2025-02-16 04:45:00,"So basically I was playing Classic Overwatch and thought to myself while playing Sombra: this heroe has changed so much! The same happened with Doomfist (I did play overwatch 1, is just that I couldn’t well remember how they felt). 

Then I realised that Sombra and Doomfist have changed so much, that they have lost their essence as heroes. Sombra was supposed to be a sneaky utility dps and now she is an assasin like every other. Doomfist used to be a high mobility combo assasin and now he is another dive tank like Winston. It’s sad seeing Doomfist and Sombra lose what was considered their identity, and I think blizzard should use perks to rework this heroes. These are my ideas: 

For Sombra she had less mobility, less assasin capabilities and more utility. When they reworked her they removed the hack problem (which was CC) and added assasin capabilities to her character, that were ultimately a detriment sin e people found an invisible assasin quite annoying (with good reason) and they started getting rid of aspects that were part of Sombra’s original kit. To this day, she assasin more. My idea is to look back at her rework in overwatch 2 and instead of turning her into an assasin, changing the utilty she had. 

Taking advantage of Sombra having a support perk, I’ll make her a support:
First of all I will add a passive to Sombra called:
 “One less heroe”: Allies that are outside Sombra’s range (20 meters or visual range) will heal 15 hp per second IF she is alive. (This passive is to encourage Sombra to flank and cause chaos in the enemy backline while still supporting her team, without Virus dealing damage or hack dealing bonus damage, she’ll be a lot less assasin, so she’ll not be super annoying). 
Hack: My goal with hack is for it to be a more “focus this enemy” ability. Bringing rewards to allies that attack hacked enemies. 
-Hack now will additionally make it so that allies that deal 100 damage to hacked targets will heal 100 burst healing. 
-Wall hacks stay the same
-Ability lockdown time reduced to 1.25 seconds. 
Hack no longer grants damage boost 
-Hack can now hack allies, which will give them wall hacks for 2 seconds and will give them a 30% speed boost for 4 seconds. 
Translocator:
-Translocator now functions exactly like overwatch 1: 
-It has a 15 second duration
-Now during translocator uptime you turn invisible, and come out while shooting (but automatically stealth in again after not doing anything for 2 seconds.) 
-To translocate now you need to be within 25 meters of your translocator. 
Virus: 
-No longer deals damage, now it can be thrown at allies (it has a small home ONLY into allies)
-When thrown into allies it now enables Sombra’s machine gun to heal (the exact same healing as damage), and has a 4 second cooldown. Lasts on allies for ten seconds. 
-when thrown on enemies, all healing they receive will heal them and then 1.5 seconds after it will detonate (completely nullifying the healing they received). It lasts for 5 seconds and (for example) if you throw the virus on a Mauga with 80 Hp, then he receives healing from Ana (75) and then he receives 90 damage, 80+75=155-90 =65: then 1.5 seconds after Ana healed him he’ll receive a burst of 75 damage (in this case killing him)(kills granted to Sombra). Has a 13 second cooldown on enemies, and can be cleanced. 

For Doomfist I want to preserve his combo potential while keeping him as a tank: This is a smaller rework but still a fun one. 
Powe block: can also empower seismic slam. 
Seismic slam: 
-damage increases over-time (from 20 damage to 100) (it rates very slowly, you would need to slam in the air a lot to get the 100 damage. 
-when empowered seismic slam now has a second usage after activation. Basically after activating it, when you touch the ground (if it is empowered), you can use it again and it will do an uppercut instead. The uppercut will do 25 damage and will waste the empowerment of the punch. It is a simple, yet fun mechanic to maintain Doom’s essence as a combo hero.

More interesting Mercy perks (Redesign),Overwatch,3,1iq5zt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1iq5zt9/more_interesting_mercy_perks_redesign/,1,2025-02-15 18:10:21,"I really like the new perk system. Most heros have really interesting options. But Blizzard could have been a bit more creative with a few of the heros. For example the only interesting perk for mercy is “Flash Heal”. Instead of complaining about the perks i dont like, I’m just going to redesign the 3 other perks to make them more inspiring. I think that will my point more clear.   


# Mercy Perks Redesign

>**Minor Perk 1: ""Friend or Foe""**  
Mercy can target enemy heroes with guardian angel.

* `Gives Mercy more possibilities to outplay her enemies`
* `Synergizes with Major Perk 2`

.

>**Minor Perk 2: ""Improved Aerodynamics""**  
Mercy's horizontal speed will not reduce during Angelic Descent.

* `Allows Mercy to keep the momentum (speed) from her GA or from enemy boops`
* `Synergizes with the knockback of Major Perk 2`
* `I think during Mercy's first movement rework in Overwatch 1, there was a version of Guardian Decent that didnt slow you down at all. You would keep your speed until you would hit the ground or use GA.`   

.

>**Major Perk 1: ""Flash Heal""**  
Resurrect can be used on Caduceus Staff’s active target to restore 150 health. Doing so incurs a 15 second cooldown.

* `This perk is not new. I kinda like Blizzards idea so I kept it.`

.

>**Major Perk 2: ""Highvelocity Impact""**  
Mercy's quick melee does 70 damage when she is traveling faster than 10 m/s (vertically or horizontally). Hitting an enemy will create a pressure wave pushing mercy and the target that was hit apart.

* `10 m/s can be reached with GA, jumping from a high place or getting booped by the enemy team.`
* `Gives Mercy's with good movement the opportunity to deal a bit of quick damage from time to time.`
* `Does work with her staff and her blaster.`
* `Can be used defensively with Minor Perk 1 to deal with enemy flankers.` 
* `Can be used aggressively with Minor Perk 1, but with great risk.`
* `Can be used defensively with Minor Perk 2 to create more distance between you and enemy flankers.`
* `Can be used aggressively with Minor Perk 2 by steering towards the enemy, but with great risk.`

.

I hope to get some feedback about these new perks. If you have some other ideas about possible mercy perks, please share them. Im interested in hearing your ideas."
Thoughts about Overwatch Spotlight and introducing perks,Overwatch,1,1ipsvmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1ipsvmh/thoughts_about_overwatch_spotlight_and/,3,2025-02-15 04:44:07,"Hey everyone, this is my first post to the subreddit. I have played Overwatch since the beginning and have been with the game as of now. There have been lots of things I have disagreed with a lot of the decisions Blizzard have made (5v5, predatory monetization, cancellation of PvE) to the game but i continue to play the game  because it’s just a game like no other. I admit the game is felt I thought that the Spotlight announcement was amazing and the introduction of perks really will be a game changer. I’m really excited with the new direction the game is going towards and I believe this will help bring back that vigor to the game and feel revitalized. 
Now I’d like to hear people’s crazy ideas that the dev team could possibly bring to the game. Now that the dev team have adapted this risky mentality the sky is the limit where they can adapt are crazy ideas. For me personally, the introduction of perks makes me think what if they develop 1-2 new ults  along with the current one  unique to each hero and we can choose which ultimate we want to use just like how they did with the perk system. It’s a crazy idea but it’s a possibility that I can hope. What do you guys think?"

Don't get me wrong, there is some cool shit coming, but for me most of it is just the same old Blizzard behavior.

They are avoiding again what the community wants and do literally everything else than fixing the problems the game currently has.
Those upcoming changes are just again a workaround that don't directly address the problems, but try to mitigate some of them with new shiny stuff. Just like S9 it's gonna be new and fresh, everything feels fine at first until people again, for the 100th time, realize that nothing really changed for the better.

All those new shiny toys we will get don't mean anything to me if the core gameplay of the game still sucks. Yes, I am talking about the broken 5v5 format nobody wanted, which still has more problems than 6v6 could ever have. Perks and new modes will not fix those problems. Couterswapping will still, even with perks, be more important and effective than trying to make your character work. If ultimates right now don't matter in the counterswap game, why would perks matter?

What I would have liked to see:

- permanent 6v6 (remove 5v5) literally just reboot the old engine, import the new heroes and maps and you literally have less work than fixing the engine to handle 6v6.

- fix the balance, more risk = more reward, instead of low skill heroes getting more value on the skill floor than high skill heroes get on their ceiling.

- let heroes be specialists again instead of generalists, not every hero needs to be playable at all times, but every hero needs to excel at their specialty.

- remove S9 health changes

- remove passives expect the passive heal

- remove/rework all those immortality (reactive) abilities (not ultimates)

- actual level borders instead of rank border

- end card system like OW1

- LFG system in game

- remove the 2 from Overwatch 2

- etc. 

What we got instead are a new pair of shoes when we needed pants and a shirt instead."

Like seriously, how is giving lucio 30% more knock back interesting in any way, shape, or form.  
How is giving Mei's secondary fire a slow going to achieve anything other than just making her blatantly stronger?  
Isn't 1 extra sec on moira fade a literally number tweak that belongs to patch notes?

Most of these perks don't even open up new playstyles. They are just plain buffs that raise the power level of the game, changing the overall feeling of the game without a reason. We players fell in love with this game because of its identity and uniqueness. How is changing the power level, an essential part of the game's identity, going to do any good? What is the vision here? I don't see.

Despite my overhelming dread and terror toward the perks system, some perks are actually very interesting.  
For example, soldier's stim pack sharing the cooldown of healing station and giving soldier himself an anti-heal is so interesting and nuanced with so much risk, reward, and decision making. You actually get to change the way you approach this game by choosing between stim packs and healing station. How is this supposed to exist in the same system with ""3sec off combat roll cd for every headshot""???  
For another example, mercy's flash heal is a type of utility with choices and decision making, which is crucial if they ever want to make people beside onetricks to ever want to play mercy. And people are supposed to choose between this and that braindead second dmg boost???????

Just to make it clear, I am not mad at Blizzard. I do not know what this perk system is going to do to the game. Nobody knows. I am just afraid that this will not work out and overwatch won't be overwatch anymore. I've never felt so worried about this game before. I did not even criticize s9 changes when it came out. Besides my fear, I am also frustrated that all those nuanced, complicated ideas are shoved into the same category with ""stronger coach gun"" and ""bigger pulse bomb."""

This chance is still <1%, but it’s something.

Blizzard said that their PvE release schedule was releasing a few missions every 18 months. Aside from just how shit that release schedule is, that means that since Invasion was released in August 2023, we still have until the end of February for literally anything.

No expectations whatsoever, they didn’t even utter the name in the Spotlight, and once March 1st comes along I can just lay it all to rest and finally move on.

But Blizzard, COME ON! These skill trees you’re adding, ‘perks’ or whatever, that’s literally all we we’ve been waiting for. Just take your Invasion missions, make them free since no one is buying them anyway, rerelease that one free King’s Row missions from Season 6, then just add some perks and maybe some challenges from the old Archives missions.

I don’t remember all 9 challenges, but I remember;

* Molten Cores: Enemies drop Molten Core puddles upon death.

* Glass Cannon: Player health is much lower, but damage is much higher, let’s say 40% health but 300% damage just as an example.

* Invincible Barriers: Come on now.

* Critical Strikes: Only headshots can deal damage.

* Storm Raging: Certain enemies spawn nano-boosted, and killing those enemies will cause other nearby enemies to also become nano-boosted.

* Blood Moon Rising: Enemies have very high life-steal on all attacks.

* Thunderstorm: Lightning will periodically follow a player around and strike the area they’re standing, like a mini Doomfist ult.

Like come on, just rerecycle what you’ve already got, take the PvE missions, add perks and some small challenges, this could be done in a weekend."

I LOVE the perks, using these new abilities during matches will be very interesting and I can't wait to try them out. My boy Zenyatta finally gets a Mythic Skin, W for Blizzard. I don't like the battle pass skins though, and I'm sick of Kiriko's skins...she got 2 new ones... and finally Venture fans will stop crying as they will get a new skin. What do u think about this season?"
"Cassidy's Perk ""Bullet Slinger"" doesn't work?",Overwatch,162,1klo4k8,https://i.redd.it/m2pydq16dk0f1.png,16,2025-05-13 16:59:47,"So, Cassidy in stadium has a perk, who should add one bullet on your maximum amo for each kill on a target you headshoted.

But for some reason, when I play it in-game, there're a lot of headshot kills that are not added in my maximum amo. It's so weird to have a useless perk... I tested it out in the practice range, but seems to work there.

Stealth Change?: Kiriko's minor perk Urgent Care,Overwatch,402,1kkosrd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kkosrd,36,2025-05-12 12:07:00,"Before  
""... when seeking critical health allies.""

After  
""... when seeking allies below half health.""

I ain't trying to say what he needs changing for base kit. I am only here to spitball ideas for some perks. And while that, I think this would be an interesting perk choice:

* Minor Perk - Remove Two Hearts
* New Minor Perk - Ring of Fire: Increase Cage Fight size by 15% (or 8 meters), and the wall can now ignite the enemy when touched.

I am not saying that Two Hearts is a bad perk; in fact, it is a great perk when it comes to specific game modes, such as Flashpoint. But I thought of this change since I noticed many heroes are getting choices for the minor perks to either beef up their ultimate or ability (or even primary fires) So I just thought why not?

Perks are such a great addition to the game, and while I have some issues with it, specifically how some of the placements of some minor/major perks are just weird, I want to see what else the devs be cooking!"

Just spitball any and all ideas you have Sombra reworks.,Overwatch,0,1kiztgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kiztgx/just_spitball_any_and_all_ideas_you_have_sombra/,16,2025-05-10 04:27:49,"Just say ideas, maybe something can be made that isn’t hated *too* much. Nothing serious, I just want to see what takes people have.

**My take:**

I want to make her a support BUT she’d still be a damage support, like Zenyatta. Her perks would let her lean more into damaging, or supporting, duh. I wanted her to be a two-sided coin, where she will hurt or heal whoever she has to to get what she wants.

I wanted to rework stealth into a meter like D.Va’s defence matrix. Stealth just feels clunky now, I want Sombra to be able to switch in and out, but it shouldn’t be permanent. The meter drains whilst invisible and lasts up to ~5 seconds with faster move speed, and it takes ~10 seconds to fully recharge. Sombra can switch in and out freely with a 1 second cooldown, like defence matrix or take a breather.

Translocator no longer grants invis of course and instead works more like the old one. Sombra can throw a Translocator and has maybe 5 seconds to teleport to it before it destroys itself. This gives Sombra more flexibility, but she also can’t just hide invisibly forever and teleport back to spawn as soon as someone sneezes in her general direction. She has to stay in the fight, but gets a sort of mini-recall, and she can maintain her vertical mobility if she needs to.

Sombra can also hack teammates by default, giving a little temporary health and some lifesteal. She also gains ultimate charge if they use her hacked health packs, but because they regenerate faster she gets less ultimate charge from them.

Her hack on enemies however is now more like a hinder. Low mobility characters are less affected than high ones of course.
Reinhardt loses charge but not shield or firestrikes, Ashe keeps dynamite but her coach gun doesn’t knock herself back anymore.

Sombra would be too supporting as a DPS, so as a support she’s more of an enabler than a healer. You’d need another support with great AoE healing like Baptiste or Moira to compensate, just raw high numbers, or you could run Sombra and Zenyatta and just have a full suicide charge team, which would be like insta-locking 4 DPS. If you can kill the enemy before they can kill you, healing isn’t required, probably.

I also now realise she has too many abilities for her buttons. Gun for left click, hack for right, invis on shift, teleport on E, virus on…virus as a part of hack would suuuuuuck. Could make it a skill-shot ultimate like pulse bomb but it’d be really underwhelming even if it charged basically instantly. Teleport on crouch like you’re laying a translocator egg? Then how would you throw it upwards?

**Perks:**

One major perk I stole from Questron I think is a new Viral Replication; if an enemy affected by Virus is killed, all other enemies in an 8M radius are also affected by Virus.

Another major perk I thought of was called Firewall, Sombra can Hack her own teammates to give them temporary immunity to debuffs like bleed, burn, anti-heal, discord, etc.

I debated between debuffs and CC, like a mini fortify, but I really didn’t want Sombra to give already mobile characters CC immunity, since I want her to do the opposite of enable these kinds of heroes. Both CC and debuff immunity was never an option, or else she could give Doomfist steroids 50% of the time.

**Cut ideas:**

One cut idea I had was called Trojan Horse, where any targets hacked by Sombra would spread the Hack to anyone they heal. This idea sounded fantastic on someone like Mercy or Ana, but I realised it would be the most overpowered thing imaginable on someone like Lucio, Baptiste or Brigitte. Lucio could at least switch to speed and Bap needs to avoid regenerative burst like it’s the plague, but Brigitte…just needs to leave I guess, she can’t fight or else she’ll heal.

An even worse idea was to invert all healing temporarily, so enemies will damage their allies instead. This idea was purged even quicker than the last one, because it’s just worse somehow.

I also quickly brainstormed some other things, like EMP leaving behind a lingering hack AoE, but I decided against it as it could just be used on point and invalidate a large chunk of the roster.

Another short lived idea was a team-wide invisibility. Take a guess why that didn’t last. Aside from how OP it would be, your teammates wouldn’t be allowed to attack if they wanted to keep their invisibility and how would that even work in some characters anyway? Again never a serious ideas, I was just cycling through whatever I could think of."

Game is still fun! New characters are cool, but I CANNOT STAND Kikiro and Juno's voices. They are so annoying to listen to. Hanzo and Widowmaker are still annoying to play against.

I used to play a lot of Junkrat and Brigitte, Junkrat feels very weak compared to the old days, maybe it's just me. Same goes for Brigitte.

I like the perks!

I was so disappointed that the story missions are paid content. Are they worth buying?

I also played a lot of Reinhardt and Roadhog and I feel like these heroes have been improved in the fun factor right now. I love playing Junker Queen.

I like the look of Hazard but man, he has NOTHING to unlock! Even his highlight intros and his emotes ARE THE SAME THING!

What is going on with all these transformers and anime skins? It feels like any original ideas the team had have been replaced by these crossover skins. I remember how everyone went crazy for the Halloween costumes, good times. Some of these skins are extremely hard to read what the actual character is, seems like bad design.

Why are there THREE currencies?! What are prisms?

Moira's voice actor is KILLING IT

I have yet to see anyone playing Wrecking Ball or Echo.

I only play casually but the chat is very quiet compared to what I remember. Not necessarily a bad thing.

Every POTG I've seen has been EXTREMELY underwhelming.

The animation for each character in character select seems to have changed and gotten worse? They often just walk up to the camera and stare at you. They used to be ICONIC and now they're lower quality. The new heroes don't seem to have the same issue.

I miss the end of round report with gold medals. Also the different endorsements you could give.

What the fudge are souvenirs and why should anyone want them?

I'm older than the average player (I assume) but this battlepass stuff is complete nonsense. The free lootboxes I get are absolute trash. I really miss the old gameplay loop compared to this stuff and even the old loop of just earning lootboxes was not great. Also, weapon charms. WHAT IS THE POINT OF THESE?!?!?"

I'd have to say I'm interested in Titus; he could be Reinhardt's rival or old friend similar to Captain America & Winter Soldier, but instead of being a giant rocket Hammer wielding, jet boosted 1 ton pickup with a bullet-laser-rocket proof window, meanwhile Titus has a much smaller and more compact Barrier that makes even Brigitte's seem large in comparison, mostly blocking chest shots from a general front angle whereas positioning it properly by looking up at an angle could block headshots, similar to a Phalanx vs an arrow storm like in the movie 300.

They would be a light HP character similar to Freja and Tracer, having their physique mostly attuned for agility and accuracy with short range spear thrusts and the ability to throw and retrieve it while utilizing a short sword up close (maybe a perk that adds a chain and allows him to pull himself toward an enemy if he spears them, like hog hook but in reverse)... basically what I'm trying to say is Pantheon from League of Legends I guess... Or maybe have him be a tank alternative to Rein that functions more like Lance from Vainglory, albeit that guy used a Lance, not a spear.

Either way, it would be cool to see a new melee type character, preferably for the DPS because Genji is lonely at the top and Venture barely counts, but I do count her nonetheless... She's at rock bottom so to speak... Although, if we make him like Pantheon, we might consider a different ultimate, maybe the ability to recall his spear after each throw for a short time, automatically refreshing its throw cooldown in the process so he can just wildly throw spears like a madman and blot out the sun in Stadium mode."

The crux of this is Gloomgauntlet, because, critically, his hammer counts as melee. This means, for 9500, you get 50 armor, 25% weapon damage (since his only weapon is melee), and max health healing on every hit. Stack this with tons of weapon lifesteal, attack power, and attack speed with Smashing and Feel the Burn, and there’s little anything can do to challenge you once you get in range. The only character that maybe stands a chance is a perfectly kitted Reaper, but even then it’s close. Your swings go north of 150 damage per hit, healing you for nearly the same, and shredding through the enemy tank very very easily. No need to spec into tons of health and shield perks, just grab Gloomgauntlet and Nebula Conduit and you’re good to go.

Lifeweaver Reworked to be a poke/dive carry,Overwatch,12,1kf8u8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kf8u8w/lifeweaver_reworked_to_be_a_pokedive_carry/,12,2025-05-05 13:03:59,"I was bored so I reworked lifeweaver to be engaging and fun

**Preface**

 \- Current strengths

* High vertical mobility - good for maps like hollywood, paraiso, numbani
* Good spam for chokes/shields
* Enables dps/tanks to take high ground (although many already have this ability)
* Consistent healing at a decently long range, especially since it can go through barriers and enemies (still won't outperform ana and bap at close ranges, single target only)
* Grippies for reinhardt/other low mobility heroes

\- Issues

* Lack of kit synergy - can do a lot of different things (spam, poke, dive)
* Life grip more consistently harms your team rather than assisting them (aside from rein or zarya), forces you to reset rather than be aggressive
* Platform doesn’t work as a standalone initiator, it's easy to rotate around and often gets stuck on payloads, doesn’t provide cover
* Main weapon works against the rest of his kit - unable to consistently focus targets, while his platform helps poke dps, life grip helps dive characters
* tree/dash - almost no utility, just encourages running away
* He's not just a low skill character with specific weaknesses (like mercy,roadhog,moira), he's a purely reactionary support with little opportunity to make plays by himself

\- Fixes

* Keep him as a main healer, make him a tactician support who enables his dps and tanks to engage
* Move away from passive playstyle, keep it more active
* Give him more utility
* Make his main weapon/heal feel more responsive and targeted
* Make his life grip and platform more engaging for allies

**Changes**

* Thorn volley
   * Lower the fire rate, increase damage and accuracy, maintain the same dps
      * (This change allows lifeweaver to more effectively 'weave' in dps between his healing blossoms. One or two thorns dealing burst damage like mei icicle are more effective than a wave of inaccurate thorns that only get value after using them for a long time)
* Petal Platform
   * Allies heal 20hp per second (same as sym's shield battery perk) while on platform, lingers 1.5 seconds after they get off
   * Platform is smaller, but petal edges are raised slightly to give more cover
   * Lasts until its broken, still lowers when not used. Increase the cooldown to 15 seconds when broken
   * (Possible perk/change) Gains a second charge
   * (Possible Perk/change) Platform gives a 20% damage boost instead of healing
      * (This change allows the platform to be used more offensively by dps, but unable to be used for the whole team. Also allows tanks life winston or  to 'stage' on it, giving them the ability to poke and create space from a safe angle. The platform soaks damage and heals until broken, giving anyone who uses it a lot of mitigation between poking or diving.
      * He can also use it himself, when his dps are out of resources he can effectively pressure using his increased accuracy and damage)

 

* Healing blossom
   * Lower the maximum healing down to 70
      * (Since platform now heals, and he deals more damage, he requires less healing to be effective)
   * Automatically charges, pressing secondary fire instantly sends it, charges the same when using thorn volley
      * (No more carpel tunnel when playing this character oml)
* Life grip
   * Instead of instantly gripping the target to lifeweavers location, instead it creates a 'tether' between lw and his ally. The ally will gain a small flower over there head, indicated on their HUD, and an option to press interact to pull themselves back towards lifeweavers location.
   * Tether lasts around 10 seconds (same as talus' rune from paladins), if unused when it expires, 50% of the cooldown will be refunded. Same cooldown. Requires constant line of sight, some leniency round corners will be given. Moving too far around a corner for more than 3 seconds will break the tether, partially refunding the cooldown.
   * Allies with the tether can press crouch to use Symettra's teleporter
   * (Possible addendum) Lifeweaver can also press the ability again to instantly pull his teammate back
   * (Possible perk/change) Tethered allies gain a small amount of healing per second
   * (Possible perk/change) Allies now teleport back to lifeweaver, no longer expires from being out of LOS
      * (This change gives lifeweavers ally the agency to decide on how they want to use life grip. Not only does it provide lifeweaver more utility to his team, lifeweaver can now be more intentional with who he tethers, giving his allies indication that he will support them for when they want to engage.
      * This can also be used in combination with his platform, allowing a dps) to take an aggressive angle, and after getting a kill, instantly grip back to their team.
      * Obviously best used for dive characters like genji or winston, but also enables low mobility heroes like rein or zarya to be more aggressive and overextend with an escape. Also gives lw's dash some use for maintaining that line of sight with your ally.)
* Tree of Life
   * Lower the duration to 10 seconds
   * Radius increased to 20 meters
   * Initial healing lowered, no longer creates over health
   * Now slows enemies inside, ramping up from 30-60% slow over 5 seconds
   * (Possible perk/change) Enemies caught in the ult for more than 5 seconds are put to sleep for 3 seconds
      * (With life weaver's current passive playstyle tree's main usage has been for when lw is getting dove. So this change gives it more utility outside of being used as a budget mei wall
      * The tree of life uses artificial pollen spores to lull the targets, slowing them over the course of its duration. The ultimate can be used more aggressively to prevent an enemy team from rotating or disengaging, allowing certain tanks to profit off of stragglers caught in the open, while gaining the upper hand from the healing received.)
* Perks
   * Minor perks
      * Life grip tether heals for 15hp/s
      * Petal platform gives 15% dmg boost
   * Major perks
      * Life grip no longer expires around corners, instantly teleports players, duration decreased to 7 seconds
      * Tree of life puts enemies to sleep (for 3 seconds) after 5 seconds

**Conclusion**

Healing and damage numbers could be changed around. Still not sure about petal platform, but giving it a flat damage boost is scary in combination with a mercy.

Best way to counter Zarya beam as Orisa?,Overwatch,1,1kewhi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kewhi1/best_way_to_counter_zarya_beam_as_orisa/,4,2025-05-05 00:38:58,It might just be me but looking through every single perk I can't find any way to counter the beam.

There's an exploit you can do in Stadium that allows you to get free Ult charge before the match starts.,Overwatch,1432,1keifc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1keifc5/theres_an_exploit_you_can_do_in_stadium_that/,36,2025-05-04 14:15:19,"So normally you can't gain ult charge this way in normal game modes because self-damage doesn't give it. But the perks that ""convert 100 HP to shields-armour"" don't give you it instantly and instead let the spawn room healing top you up. So if you have someone healing you (or you heal yourself as Moira, Lucio, or Soldier) and spam taking and selling those two perks, your healers can get a good 20% ult charge before the match starts for free per person doing this. It's even stupider on Colosseo which has the small room that doesn't have the healing aura in it's spawn so this is even easier to do with more potential ult gain.

A new hero that in my opinion may need a rework.,Overwatch,0,1ke956a,https://v.redd.it/sokk9mkqboye1,10,2025-05-04 04:10:41,"Aside from many other heroes that need to be reworked (such as sojourn) is Freja. The fact that she can rapidly shoot her explosive arrows at a maximum of 3 times pre-perks (4 times post-perks) is insane to me. The video I attached below shows a Freja's POV that I was up against using 3 of them rapidly. Although she didn't hit anyone in this particular clip, she did it to me and my teammates several times and the amount of damage with stacked explosive arrows it's 100% insta-kill unless you're a tank. The only reason I'm using this clip is because it better displays how fast she can shoot them. To those who don't play Freja, every time you use Take Aim (used to shoot an explosive arrow), if you use Quick Dash, it resets Take Aim, meaning you can shoot another explosive arrows one after another, far faster than waiting to reload them in between shots. Freja, in my opinion, is already strong enough, but this? It's literally another junkrat, but with the properties of Hanzo, and that's a little too powerful—in my opinion.

Sigma is basically guaranteed to have some sort of free flight, and Zenyatta isn’t far behind with at least a hover or glide.

Junkrat would be complete ass that season with all of the flying characters, unless they straight up give him hitscan grenades or a floating trap.

And then in Season 18 we’ll get Winston, Brigitte, Sojourn 🤢 and also Aqua who no one seems to be mentioning as a mid-season addition.

There’s got to be a GOATS Brig build somewhere in there, with maybe a lifesteal Inspire or fire build like Reinhardt and Ashe.

Winston is getting chain lighting and I hope there’s an actual sniper monke build, like how in the Hero Mastery Winston’s Lightning will chain between the same two targets half a dozen times.

And Sojourn…I played a game against an Ashe, Cass and Mercy and we had no counter hits an and that fucking suuuuucked, having two snipers ever at all in any way is gonna suck unless I can glue a full-auto assault rifle to D.Va’s mech or Reinhardt can just throw his hammer.

This is a really big problem for brig because the whip perk helps her SO MUCH in 1v1s but dropping the shield can be instant death because it has a delay on going back up again.

I've had the thought process of ""i need to run away from this so I can safely skill my perk"". I can't fight it without the perk and I can't put my shield down in the middle of the fight. I must run away.

Blizz swapped the position of Juno's crit perk in the last balance patch. That caused me to misclick a couple times.

Very fun and pretty strong stadium juno build for people bored of torpedoes,Overwatch,0,1kc8piv,https://i.redd.it/mce88l9h96ye1.jpeg,7,2025-05-01 15:27:19,"There are a good amount of items in stadium that trigger on spell cast and juno has a power that gives her 3 charges of glide boost, you can probably imagine where this is going.

With this build, you can cast glide boosts for literally every single shot you fire with your weapon, and you gain the following buffs every time you cast it:  
\-bonus damage and healing on your next shot  
\-movement speed  
\-25 overhealth  
\-armour and shield regen  
\-weapon power

And on top of this each shot you fire gives you bonus AP to buff both mark of the kitsune, stinger, missiles, and hyper healer.

This build is super fun and feels really expressive and high APM which i enjoy a lot, and from the couple of games ive played with it you have really strong healing, mobility, damage output, and can give a lot of overhealth to teammates later on.  


I personally go stinger first as blink boosts doesnt do as much without items but i imagine you can switch up power order or go torpedoes instead of hyper ring upgrades after the core perks.  


I encourage people to try it if they are bored of going torpedo build every game."
Moira Power Combo Broken/Bugged? (Stadium),Overwatch,2,1kbzrul,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kbzrul/moira_power_combo_brokenbugged_stadium/,2,2025-05-01 05:59:33,"Hello everyone!

I am here to report that a power combo I suspected should work together don't and I was wondering if it's a bug or intentional. 

If you take the empowering power that lets you damage boost allies there are a few bugs with it and a combo doesn't work when I think theoretically it should?

The combo that I think is broken and doesn't work is the (Empowering you) + (Chain Grasp). The reason that I believe these are broken is because if I am able to target my allies then shouldn't the chain work on allies as well? The way the power normally works is when you throw an orb the damage beam chains between enemies but if you have the empowering perk shouldn't it also chain the blue beam between allies?

The bugs I have noticed are the damage beam will apply to the person you first aimed it at even if you switch to another allied player without letting go of the damage input. For example I damage boost mei and I flick it over to reaper the boost stays on mei even if I am not looking at her and the new target doesn't get it.

Another bug is that if you have the combo mentioned above, if it doesn't chain to allies I can understand for balance reasons. But if you take chain grasp and throw an orb then damage boost your tank who is surrounded by enemies? The grasp doesn't chain to the enemies either. Meaning if you take this combo you are actively harming your output and nerfing one of your perks.

Thank you for reading!"

A few days into Stadium and it's making me realize the value of League's separate stat for heal and shield power,Overwatch,0,1kairtu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kairtu/a_few_days_into_stadium_and_its_making_me_realize/,8,2025-04-29 10:12:29,"I think a lot of people can agree that Zarya, Juno and such are pretty strong. Personally I don't think the actual perks should be nerfed (the only one I think that needs a Nerf/change because it's too much imo would be Soldier's free visors), though I do think there is just a whole lot of value with how it's done right now.

For example I'll talk specifically about Juno's torpedoes, genuinely speaking it's fun to be able to do a lot of damage and heal, but it means she kinda just does everything well. She can spec into crit if she wants, can just go full AP and nuke your hp, all while still outputting extreme healing, while other supports don't get that same raw value out of stats like Mercy.  
To combat too much of everything League of Legends, when faced with a similar problem, made items with Heal+Shield power. In other words, the could give little to no AP while still boosting the strength of your heal, and simultaneously could either separate the damage AP scaling from the heal AP scaling (generally making heals scale worse with just raw AP) this meant that while you can go AP on supports to do so would be sacrificing a bit of sustain (and generally you still wouldn't be at DPS levels of damage but that isn't always the case).

This I think would GREATLY benefit the balance of this mode. Stronger late game items and more diverse scaling. You could nerf AP on Zarya without completely gutting big bubbles, and nerf Juno's torpedoes without removing the option to do damage or mass heal your team.

This I think extends to a lot of late game items, I think they just are too safe at times and survival items feel less good imo than damage/ap items due to visible effects like giving anti-effects.  
This is something I generally think could be improved in mid season and next season in making items (especially late game ones) feel more like big MOBA items while also addressing some of the really scummy things to play against without just erasing that playstyle for the people who enjoy it."

Zarya with a bubble build is incredibly dissatisfying to play against as everything you do gets padded down to having near zero impact. 

For heroes like Reaper, there just aren't that wildly character changing perks where he would suddenly get good at range. The perks don't give enough counter opportunity to offset character counters, which is really bad when you're locked to one hero.

I just posted asking for opinions on Stadium, made the mistake of not first just looking up “Stadium” in the search bar and seeing a crazy amount of hate.

I don’t really get it? I mean I understand that the time between matches takes a while, but usually I spend at least 45 seconds to a minute tryna figure out what items to buy (if you’re making the same build every game and then complaining abt your loses, be quiet and learn the new game mode), the rest is basically the same as waiting for a regular game to start, maybe an extra 10 seconds to check your phone. It ain’t that long, what am I missing?

The rest of the complaints seem to be all about teammates and toxic people. Genuine question, is it any more toxic than regular comp? Also, really basic thing here guys, but if you see someone acting toxic to a teammate/enemy in chat- call them out and defend it. MAKE things not toxic. It’s very, very, very easy to do and it ALWAYS makes the game a lot better. Seriously I think maybe this is a key thing that’s letting me actually have fun, just be chill and remember it’s just a game.

I get that some builds are really strong and some heroes are oppressive… this gamemode hasn’t even been out for a week, there are only like 15 heroes available. Of course it’s a bit unbalanced, they’re still making changes and adding stuff to balance it, and there aren’t a lot of options for team comps.

This will get downvotes, whatever, but I really don’t understand all the complaining. If I can ask something else, what do yall want? Were perks good? I don’t check this stuff enough, I love perks too but apparently everyone is hating on everything so maybe im crazy. 

Really though, what do you want them to change or add to this game? How did you want Stadium to be different?

Moira and Kiriko seemed unbelievably strong on day one, but are now completely useless in my opinion. Aside the odd situational double cleanse.

Juno and Mercy are top tier followed by ana then Lucio in bottom tier.

I'm not going to go into full build lists.

S Tier Juno

Her early game isn't the best, she peaks at game 3. 

Her build is really simple, max out ability power and throw in cool down where you can as a second priority and go torpedo spam


S Tier Mercy 
She is strong in every round

Go tanky and Rez everyone easily, pick up the 15% extra healing when you can.

Best early perks are convert 100 health to armour and reduce incoming damage by 10%

Avoid battle mercy it's a trap

A tier Ana
No scope build is best going full attack damage and taking the larger projectiles perk

B tier Moira
The only build worth mentioning is ability power ap build, she's too squishy for anything else

C tier kiriko
Damage is the way and double cleanse


D tier Lucio D tier go double book and ability power, be super squishy hope for the best.

Lucio is a lot worse in this mode mainly because of third person he's far easier to track

Stadium starts fun and becomes a doozy of a drain quickly,Overwatch,0,1k7zf53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k7zf53/stadium_starts_fun_and_becomes_a_doozy_of_a_drain/,4,2025-04-26 01:48:13,"Don't get me wrong - Stadium can be a lot of fun with long lasting final fights. I really enjoyed Mei as wrecking ball. I had a few of my most intense fights in the stadium these days. Nonetheless, there are a lot of issues that were raised partially by others as well.

\- the matches are way too long - 3 rounds out of 5 would be more appropriate

\- team diffs are snowballing because of being able to buy better perks earlier than the other team helping to get more stadium currency even by better performance.

\- it should be possible to switch heroes after each round. Having a team comp that is countered by the enemy team comp won't be fun for a whole half hour.

\- there is seemingly no leaver penalty and there is no reward for the winning team if the whole enemy team forfeits

\- I am having ambiguous feelings about forfeit options. Often enough, matches can turn around in round 3 at the latest with new perks or people switching up.

\- The matchmaking is worse than in QP, even. It seems that everybody is thrown in at Bronze and has to land on top. I had my share of fights fighting against people two ranks higher than me or even top 500 - not cool, not cool.

\- with so many perks, it is not balanced at all and probably will never be.

\- event loot requires people to queue for all roles or even are an incentive to play every hero with let's say varying success. This makes matches even worse.

  
Personally, I will most likely wait for the first patch to stadium to fix the most urgents nagging points. "
I really want to love stadium but..,Overwatch,53,1k7slkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k7slkc/i_really_want_to_love_stadium_but/,59,2025-04-25 20:46:17,"Maaaan, is it just not a fun time for me right now. Every game there is an unkillable reaper and a aimbotting soldier, the games take literal eternity to finish, the performance is kinda not great (low 80 frames rather than the 150 I usually get) and lastly..no xp.

I know they've mentioned about tweaking the number but who in their right mind okay'ed saltine boys aimbot perk?? How is it literally the first one??

Did they nerf Rein when I wasn't looking?

I just played a game and Rein's health was 550 AND one of his perks has been changed. I remember playing games a few days ago where his health was 700, and I have clips saved on my console showing me with 700 health when I walk out of the room. Am I insane? What is happening?

Also, his first perk has been changed. No longer does it let the firestrike recharge his shield (which can be extremely handy with helping keep you and your team alive), and instead it just gives you an extra firestrike if you stun (which I think is bull, as Rein's charge is - while fun - doesn't do as much damage for how finkiy it is to actually pin someone)."

If your main isn't in Stadium yet....,Overwatch,8,1k79oc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k79oc5/if_your_main_isnt_in_stadium_yet/,15,2025-04-25 04:03:40,"What kind of power upgrades and modifiers do you think they'll have when they make the leap over? 

I'm a Lifeweaver main, and I reckon he'll get the ability to heal more than one target at a time with his primary fire.  I could see his little heal shots splitting off from the main target and targeting nearby allies for a lower heal value. 

  
I also see him being able to detonate his platform and deal damage with it. I could also see the platform getting a modifier that heals people over time when they stand on it. There could also be another that boosts damage, I think. 

  
I think when it comes to Life Grip, I reckon they'll give him modifiers that cause gripped allies to leave an explosion where they were to deal damage to enemies in the area. I think he'll probably also have options to increase healing on his grip as well.

  
When it comes to his secondary fire, I think they'll probably just port over Superbloom from the perk system as well as giving him the typical lifesteal options. 

  
For his ult, I don't think they would do anything too crazy, probably just longer durations, more healing waves etc. My only 'interesting' idea for it would be if the healing waves also knock back enemies.



It's fun to think about really, so if your main is currently MIA, what tools and modifiers do you think they'll get when they're added? "

Why are we wasting bans on Sombra?,Overwatch,0,1k6m0q3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k6m0q3/why_are_we_wasting_bans_on_sombra/,29,2025-04-24 09:05:19,"Before you say it, no I am not a sombra main. I’m not even a DPS main. 

Without exaggeration, in every one of my games so far (Gold lobbies), sombra is banned. But if no one on the team is hard countered by her, then why are we immediately banning her? This is especially frustrating when we’re on a map that is particularly strong for a specific hero (*cough* widow *cough*) or comp. 

Take it from a support main who’s been through hell and back with sombra, she is so easy to deal. Although, with her new perk change that lets her stay invisible indefinitely, I might change my stance on that. But my point is, all I’m asking for is a little thought to why we’re banning specific heroes. Maybe that’s too much to ask of Gold players. "

The best Stadium comp right now (personal opinion),Overwatch,165,1k6k13u,https://i.redd.it/uyvk65ezrpwe1.jpeg,133,2025-04-24 06:55:11,"- Junker Queen has pretty crazy survivability and utility. Pair shout resetting with shout giving you wound healing and hard stack your ability power, you'll have 500 overhealth pretty much whenever you want. Double carnage and increased carnage lifesteal also just buffs this further. No tank comes close to the raw sustain, and with how much damage DPS can do, that's what matters right now.
 
- Cass is completely busted once you get to round 3. Hard stack weapon power and damage main powers. Fan the hammer, roll, fan the hammer. Insta deletes anyone. 

- Much like Cass, Soilder gets busted when you hard stack weapon power. Couple that with decreased cooldowns and the Visor after Helix power, you pretty much become a legal cheater. With a Mercy pocket you essentially become the server admin.

- Juno is interchangeable with Kiriko for the 1st support, but I think she takes the cake. Pulse Torpedoes perks plus stacking ability power allows you to pump CRAZY healing and damage every couple seconds. Of course, mobility with her hyper ring is always a nice bonus.

- As always, Mercy is boosted by the people she can pocket. Literally just pocket soilder or cass for a free win if the enemy doesn't have a Mercy. With increased survivability and super short res cooldowns you'll pretty much always be able to get res off too. She's just really really good at making the busted abilities even more busted. I can't believe I am saying this, but I go into games HOPING for a Mercy"

The 6v6 return  was going in the right direction . But hero bans seems like it is doing the opposite of what comp was supposed to do: Be competitive . It was about how good you knew how to play characters and counter the enemy team. If you were that Zen getting picked off by reaper / somber , switch off zen go and go Kuriko or Moria . Maybe have a dps go Cassidy. Tired of that pharaoh, go hitscan and  shield  etc . It was about how well you can adjust or who you played to get the win . Balance hero’s all day . Make new ones . Being in 6v6. Add perks . But for the love of all things holy , don’t allow people to remove heroes from a match because they don’t want to adjust in order to beat the enemy team. That’s a skill issue and that’s the point of competitive . I can even see adding this feature for lower tiers like gold or below , but it’s no reason why someone can’t counter a character in a diamond lobby.  I was literally support in a lobby where the stacked enemy team banned all the hard counters to hog and watched my team get walked . I was on a team that did something similar to dog walk the other team. And this is supposed to be balanced ? They have quick play and arcade but comp ? What are we doing ? What are your  thoughts about it ?

I play all of the hero’s  except doom , hammy, zen, hanzo, wid. So.. yeah not really an issue with adjusting on my end "

Similarly, I’m a bit confused about Zarya perks which give ‘ability power’. I suppose there are some perks which give grav damage and the one that boosts secondary fire. But if you don’t have those, what does ability power actually do - is it just useless? Because it’s defined as ‘increased the damage and healing of your abilities and ultimates that don’t rely on your weapons.

Initial Stadium thoughts: Adds good variety but sometimes misses the mark,Overwatch,6,1k5q0mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k5q0mc/initial_stadium_thoughts_adds_good_variety_but/,2,2025-04-23 05:55:36,"Here are my initial thoughts on Stadium after about 5 hours of gameplay:

- Abilities are all super fun but some of them are absolutely horrible to play into. Rein, Mei, Cassidy, Soilder the standouts in this regard. 
/
- After a couple of rounds when everyone has crazy HP fights can pretty much become endless until a couple of people hit big ults. Massive HP pools and tons of lifesteal and damage reduction makes fights drag on for super long sometimes. That baby Dva nano perk especially makes her unbelievable at stalling, especially as the increased HP also affects her when she's out of mek.
/
- Lots of performance issues currently, huge resolution and frame rate drops regardless of hardware. Hopefully these are fixed ASAP.
/
- This mode absolutely feels like an entire new game and nothing like OW, which is good and bad. It's great to have more variety in the game and this will almost certainly help with the feeling of being burnt out by the game. For me at least, however, it definitely won't overtake normal OW as my main mode. It'll be a nice side show to go to occasionally, nothing more or less.
/
- For me there should be a *little* more reward if you lose a game. Each game can go beyond half an hour and usually will, so losing is especially painful, and getting hardly anything (only get 1 comp progress to the 100 points) adds to the pain. Even some pity comp points, like 5 per loss, would be better.

This mostly sounds negative but I'm still having a ton of fun on Stadium. It absolutely has potential and I'm hopeful some of the more obvious issues can be fixed soon. For now, however, Stadium is a mixed bag of fun and frustration."

They arent bad, but they can be more interesting. After all, one cleanses, which kinda should be base kit, and the other requires you to die, which kinda seems antithesis to the game.
That is why I think that we remove the cleanse effect for pull and make it base kit, but in exchange remove its burst heal. This is because the first perk I have in mind would be that the pull would now heal the allie for a set minimum and extend it the longer the grap was. That could interesting as that would make into a true life line, especially for the aggressive teammates. 
The second perk would obviously remove the death perk, and instead, it would be replaced by a new perk where, like Torb, the petal platform would now be placed in vertically. As such, not only can it be an elevator, but it may even serve as a self made shield or blockade. But for me, I would use it as a new sneaky way to push enemies off the maps.

My take on my preferred Brigitte Major Perks,Overwatch,13,1k4k1ug,https://i.redd.it/1jqfvgrg98we1.png,9,2025-04-21 20:01:07,"Imo the cornerstone of Brigs hero identity, at least how I play her is as a body guard. I've missed her ability to pick a teammate to make extra durable BEFORE they get dove, I found it a very fun form of skill expression, guessing who would be dove or who I want to give a better chance of survival. 

This imo is a solid difficult choice without either option being too overpowered. Obvi the extra armor expires eventually, and the added cost of using her own shield to protect an ally makes it more balanced than old brig but is still thematic.

"Bastion's ""Armored Artillery"" perk should give Armor instead of temporary Overhealth",Overwatch,0,1k1s0k1,https://i.redd.it/mjfb4dgmkhve1.png,4,2025-04-18 02:27:00,"Let me elaborate. Currently, this perk gives you 300 overhealth that quickly decays after 3 seconds. This perk is useful only for one or two things. To save yourself by Ult'ing if you're about to die.

I think this is a pretty limited use-case which is not very interesting.

This perk should be reworked into giving Armor that *doesn't* decay over time. It can still be chipped away by taking damage and DOES NOT replenish. When your armor is gone, you can't get it back unless ult'ing again.

I think this would allow Bastion to become a temporary Tank. After ult'ing (which puts pressure on your enemies), you can pressure them even more by then going into Assault mode with a whopping 600 HP total. And this still allows you to save yourself if you're in a pinch.

Is this overpowered? Maybe. I just think that right now this perk is very boring and this would add more depth to his playstyle."

Thoughts From a Returning Player,Overwatch,2,1k1mjxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1k1mjxj/thoughts_from_a_returning_player/,1,2025-04-17 22:15:39,"Hello, I've played a bit off and on over the years but the times I played overwatch most seriously (so more than dabbling for like a week) was back on launch in 2016, later in 2017 where I achieved grandmaster back in a very different era, and then later during the launch of overwatch 2. I played a bit around the release of lifeweaver as well but don't really remember what that was like. I wanted to share some thoughts on the way the game has changed since then.

First; Perks are a good addition to the game. I don't need to elaborate on this as it has been said before. 

Second: I do not like 6v6 as much as 5v5. Might be a surprising take given content creators seem to prefer 6v6, but I feel my individual impact is way lower in this mode and my decisions less important. What might be more surprising is I'm a tank player and still hold this opinion. It may change with time but every time I go into 6v6 I come out feeling substantially dumber than I went in.

Third: Clash gamemode was removed from comp for good reasons, clearly. I do not like this mode at all.

Thoughts on new heroes:

Juno: For the longest time I wasn't even sure what this hero actually did and just treated it as a free kill. In fact my first experience was killing her and wondering who I just killed because I had no knowledge of her existence prior. After playing all season she's nice to have on my team, nor do I hate her on the enemy team. I do not like her ultimate and think the game needs less Giant healing/damage AoE.

Venture: I love having this hero on my team, truly the people who play this hero are willing to join me in going deep into the enemy lines and it's a joy to be able to see a hero lock in that I know isn't gonna be a pansy who stands behind the choke and gets upset if the game moves fast.

Hazard: Hard to play, but inoffensive. He seems like a strong generalist dive tank. I can't understand what he is saying so the accent is accurate.

I think the game is in a great spot save for arcade which feels de emphasized by the player base. I can no longer grind deathmatch to practice duels because the full lobbies just do not last for more than a few minutes and I immediately crush them... Deathmatch was actually my favorite mode so it's sad to see where things are.

I am excited for hero bans and await sending Brig and Ana to the shadow realm when possible. I think the overall balance is okay but I dislike some of the support 'denial' abilities which I find anti-fun.

See you guys out there next season as for once I'll be sticking around as I attempt to reclaim my ranked glory"

Perks were really fun and thankfully didnt cause any mahor issues so far. I still fear they might become problematic in the future but for this season alone it was really fun exploring new stuff.

Loot boxes were goated, really fun addition

Comp was pretty good overall, orisa was mid and mauga was trash, so way better experience for tanks, zarya is a problem but she hadnt gotten the spotlight so I assume she'll get more nerfed soon. Sojourn is the spawn of Satan but hero bans will take care of the issue so its fine.

6v6 and April fools mode were incredible, I really liked the variety of rosters you could pick in open queue. And normalwatch was just hilarious. 

So many things to do and lots of fun new features and mode and not that much out of the ordinary to be mad about, so I applaud the team for their efforts especially during a time where there's tough competition. Definitely one of the most goated seasons.

I think its a good time to be playing overwatch as opposed to a few months ago.

Junkerqueen feels terrible to play in 6v6 due to her fragility - she doesn’t feel like a tank,Overwatch,0,1jykft0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1jykft0/junkerqueen_feels_terrible_to_play_in_6v6_due_to/,39,2025-04-14 00:57:49,"If you thought having 0 mitigation, 0 shields, and 0 armor in 5v5 was rough enough, try that with 6v6 with only 425 HP.

Her only saving grace is her perks which give her just a bit more sustainability (but they still require you to even hit/use your cooldowns - namely Axe - without inting)

There is 0 room for error now in 6v6 for her. You have to hit everything when ur against half the roster who can easily make your time miserable and now can actually almost 1v1 you if you miss or do not have any cooldowns. 

I don’t feel like a tank, I literally have to hide behind cover and look for an assassination / flank route with my cooldowns up. 

I’m again Zen’s and Ana’s who know I’m fragile and will just 1 shot / anti me and blow me up. Even Hog can sometimes live through an anti because take a breather has damage reduction. Where I have 0 mitigation. 

I’m saying this even though I still have a positive winrate on her in 6v6 (like 60%) - but it’s mostly through my mechanics. It still just doesn’t feel good at all and I die much more than I would like because of how fragile I am. Yes, I still get adrenaline rushes from hitting big Ults and axes but it’s even more riskier without getting blown up before I even get it off 😂, unless I take an off-route."

I've been a big Ashe and Cass player for awhile now, but Freja just scratches some itch that those characters don't.

Take Aim is a literal firework of dopamine every damn time I score a critical hit with it. Something about jumping into the air, dashing into the enemy sightlines, popping some support in the skull, dashing back into cover and seeing the elimination icon seconds later gives this ""You are already dead"" type of feeling. It's so fun. It's literally so fun that she gets this Widowmaker syndrome of never using her primary fire, since her secondary is just beyond satisfying. Not to mention how good Take Aim is at removing armour, making her a solid pick for countering certain tanks if you can get the dash down.

I think one of my favourite parts about her is that she's a glass cannon. She does an intense amount of dps in the right hands, but her ""float in the air when ADS"" ability makes it so that any good hitscan hero and snipe her fairly quickly while she's airborne. She rewards new players with a lot of dps, but will just as quickly punish them if they don't grasp her weaknesses. 

Usually when a new OW character comes out, I have this period of thinking ""Yeah! This'll be \*my\* hero"", before finding out their weakpoints and going back to my comfort picks. But Freja is different. I think I've played a single match of Overwatch since Freja's playtest ended, and I really don't want to go back until she gets here. High mobility, high skill ceiling, rewarding gameplay, well-balanced (In my eyes, at least) and solid perks. What's not to like?

I'm counting down the days until Freja gets released, and I can't wait to hop back into my future main. "
Why is Sombra getting a Buff in the new patch notes?,Overwatch,0,1jybzfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1jybzfm/why_is_sombra_getting_a_buff_in_the_new_patch/,21,2025-04-13 18:44:58,"ETA: Thank you to everyone who has explained it to me!

""Viral Replication (Major Perk): Will replace Stack Overflow (Hack's silence duration is increased by 100%, but its range is decreased by 15%). ""Allows her Virus to spread to nearby enemies.""""

From what I've heard many people actually wanted Sombra to get a nerf because she's become very hard to deal with in games - So seeing she got a buff in the latest patch notes confused the heck out of me?

In every game I've been in, nobody can seem to deal with a Sombra, she's always managing to pick of supports and even DPS when people C9! Isn't this just going to make it worse? :')

"IMO Ability Replacement perks should just add new abilities, not replace existing ones.",Overwatch,0,1jxmlm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1jxmlm6/imo_ability_replacement_perks_should_just_add_new/,25,2025-04-12 19:29:31,"I believe perks have overall been a great addition to Overwatch, revitalizing the game and bringing much needed variation and unpredictability to matches. However, my biggest complaint with perks is the fact that it feels like the power level of the perks was not distributed equally.

This can be seen most evidently in ""replacement"" perks, such as Bastion's tank form, or Orisa's shield. Rather than being actual ""perks"", as in additional upside's, they feel more like excuses to give players the chance to reuse old abilities. That sentiment by itself is actually a great idea for a perk, but it comes at the cost of one of the hero's existing abilities. Bastion's turret form is replaced with tank form, removing his high dps hitscan options and making him struggle against flying heroes more, and Orisa's javelin spin is replaced with her shield, removing her only mobility option and an incredibly useful matrix utility. These heroes don't gain any upsides, they replace their current utility with different utility. This makes their usefulness situational instead of always beneficial, and in some cases choosing the wrong perk can be a straight up nerf.

Contrast this with perks like Ana's. Every single one of Ana's perks is a straight upgrade. Her self nano perk literally gives her two ultimates for the price of one. There is no situation where any one of Ana's perks would only be situationally useful. Her utility is not replaced in any way, the only choice she makes is the choice between what buff she wants. While the value of each perk does vary between situations, meaning some will be more beneficial in one instance than another, she is never nerfed compared to her previous state for choosing the ""wrong"" perk.

This comes down to a matter of opinion. Maybe you prefer the limitations of Bastion's and Orisa's perk, and think Ana is the outlier who needs to be nerfed. Personally, I would rather see hero's get buffed, and instead just let heroes like Bastion and Orisa get their new abilities ontop of their existing kits. While the balance of perks certainly highlights the favoritism towards some heroes like Ana, those balance decisions do get results. There is a reason Ana is the most played hero in the game, being able to do straight up more ontop of what you could already do is fun. One of the perks biggest design philosophies was to not focus as much on balance, but more on fun. I think it is more fun to give players more, rather than take something away in return."

Note: A lot of Talon characters aren't actually members of Talon, but you may notice how Talon's roster is smaller than Overwatch's. If it was solely Talon-affiliated characters, I'm not exaggerating when I say they would only have seven characters.

A la comp, Battle Mode is played in rounds, and you can earn perks. However, you don't earn them by earning XP. At some point during the round, Null Sector enemies will begin spawning in and attacking both teams. Later, Ramattra will also spawn in and attack both teams. Once Ramattra dies, no more Null Sector units will spawn in. Killing Null Sector units earns each team points, with more awarded for killing tougher threats. The side that gets the most points gets a perk level up in the next round. If a team has reached perk level 3 and the game goes into another round, the other side will automatically get the level up. If both teams have a tie, the level up goes to the team that killed Ramattra."

Get A Lot Of Toxicity When I Play Genji,Overwatch,1,1jr5dns,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1jr5dns/get_a_lot_of_toxicity_when_i_play_genji/,11,2025-04-04 08:31:04,"Long story short, I've been playing a lot of Genji recently and nowadays like every other match, I get people bagging and calling out to me in match chat. Is there some stigma toward Genji? Is he overpowered? I only really play quickplay to chill and I usually do pretty well whether we win or lose.

Literally in the last 5 matches I've played as Genji, 3 of them I've had people bag and trash me. They say Genji trash/scum, called me a rat, tell me to touch grass - am I tripping when I say it's literally just quickplay??? It's been more frequent as of late; he's easily my most played DPS now with 20 hours but I don't tbag or trash talk in match chat. The only match I've even been heavily pocketed was recently, where the Mercy and Ana helped me pop off - I vividly remember it because our Ana said, ""gg genji thug"".

Did he get significantly stronger through perks? I can do way better on Ashe or Tracer but I don't receive any toxicity when I play them. Is he easy to play now? Are people just rage baiting? Playing him has gotten me by far the most toxicity compared to literally every other character and role. Even compared to when I played comp, in the gold-plat range, it was a lot more tame. I just want to chill and play but it's starting to get a bit annoying with how much more it's been happening; especially when I die and multiple people from the enemy team tbag my corpse.

edit: probably should've clarified, i receive little to no negativity from teammates. it's just the amount of toxicity from the other team that's driving me away from playing him"

Sombra support rework Concept,Overwatch,0,1jpt4nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1jpt4nd/sombra_support_rework_concept/,3,2025-04-02 18:38:07,"Sombra has been reworked and changed over and over and over again. There just seems to be no end to it and no matter what the changes are somebody is always left unhappy. With the addition of perks we got the White Hat perk which lets sombra play in a sort of semi/off-support way, occasionally clutch healing teammates while still being able to do her job as a DPS. Personally i think this way of playing sombra is way, WAY more fun (probably because i'm a support main) and so i came up with this rework that leans into that off-support way of playing with her focusing much less on high sustained healing output and more on short and infrequent bursts of healing and actually supporting her teammates through buffs and setups while trying to partially make up for that lack of personal healing by helping the other support do their job easier by being decent at peeling and also helping them to target their healing.   
Please read and i hope you enjoy!

The perks I want for Juno,Overwatch,3,1jpnjiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1jpnjiz/the_perks_i_want_for_juno/,5,2025-04-02 14:38:45,"As a Juno main I found the perks pretty boring and often useless. Most feedback has been not that negative, with some perks generally considered mediocre and some considered bad, the latter being buffed.

I think its important to note that Juno has a lot of mobility but it is ""meh"" mobility that allows her to go from A to B faster and minor dodging, but can not compare with the ""get out of jail free card"" and dodging other heroes get. She does not need more half-assed tools to get around.

# Current perks and why I don't like them

**Familiar vitals**: This is a very minor speed up, taking into account that your teammates are likely to be closer and thus lockon would be already fast, and if they are far, the projectile still has to travel to them anyway.

**Hyper boost**: To get the effect you need to burn two cooldows you probably want to rotate or save ring for a teammate. In exchange you get the ability to move back and forth in place in a predictable manner and without fine control.

**Master blaster**: 50% more of very little is still little. Juno is not a fighter and this barely helps her. Also, to get that 50% damage you need precision with a burst fire gun.

**Re-boots**: This is useful to get height in some maps, but as I said before, Juno has enough mediocre mobility options. The extra duration is not necessary most of the time because you would be rotating your speed boosts.

# What I would like to see

**Re-boost**: Glide boost grants one extra dash, pressing shift while boosting will let Juno dash again. Press a third time to cancel. This provides Juno with a bit more dodging that the player can actually control (useful mobility).

**Longer blaster**: Mediblaster falloff range is moved 5 meters away. This allows Juno to pressure/heal effectively from a few more positions. It contrasts with the other perk, which offers more survivability in the more aggressive positions needed with shorter range.

**Torpedo efficiency**: If pulsar torpedoes fires less than 3 torpedoes (1 or 2), cooldown is halved. This changes the way torpedoes are used, making it worthwhile to use it on fewer targets instead of trying to go for a full spread.

**Pulsar shielding**: Pulsar torpedoes grants 25 extra health for the duration, making it easier to survive while targeting. This makes the decision between the major perks much more interesting and encourages slightly different playstyles."
Balance gone,Overwatch,0,1jnvlcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1jnvlcn/balance_gone/,8,2025-03-31 06:57:14,"As a console player (high plat to low diamond), this is just my experience—results may vary!

After spending a lot of time with the perks and the latest update, and waiting through a couple of patches to see how the devs handle things, I feel like Overwatch 2 is the least balanced it’s been since Seasons 5-6. The only times that felt worse, in my opinion, were the Uber Queen patch and Mauga’s initial release.

Honestly, I think this shift might be intentional. With the introduction of perks, it feels like the devs are moving away from a more balanced, competitive experience and leaning into fast, high-impact gameplay instead. That said, this is still the first season with perks, so there’s obviously time for things to change and improve as the system evolves.

What do you all think? Have you noticed the same trend?"

Junkrat perk idea?,Overwatch,2,1jlzmaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1jlzmaf/junkrat_perk_idea/,5,2025-03-28 17:50:43,"EDIT removed the charge mine idea, I was under the impression from the description of the ability that it wouldn't detonate until it was armed. They really need to word that better

Okay, so some heroes have some pretty balanced perks, yeah? They often fit with the play style and work well depending on the situation. However, junkrat I believe only has two good perks, and that's the aluminum trap and frag cannon, leaving the nitro tire and the enhanced concussion mine as undesirable. So I'm going to suggest a new major and minor perk that might end up being a tad more useful. So I'd like to ask for feedback, and please be honest but also fair.

Minor perk : mayhem tire. When the riptire is destroyed, It lets out a few of junkrat's explosive bocce balls. This can be pretty useful to make sure that ripped tires not completely wasted if it gets close enough, but it's not enough to change the entire flow of the game which is why I think it's worthy of a minor perk. 

I do have some other ideas but they might not be nearly as viable, like a major perk that increases the projectile speed as well as explosion radius of the frag launcher, but all the projectiles only bounce one time. Or something like the April fool's update where you can have multiple traps at once. But that would require changing the aluminum trap and frag Cannon, And I feel like those are pretty well balanced anyways. 

After all that said and done, I do appreciate the changes made by the perks, they do appear to be very useful in certain situations, they just don't fit junk rats general play style, which is the spam choke points, fly around using explosives, and obliterate in tight spaces. But I would like to know what you guys think, if these are good or bad, or if there could be a change to either of these that would make it even more useful. Again, please be honest but respectful

Thoughts on indicators for enemies with 90%+ ult charge?,Overwatch,0,1jl7n0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1jl7n0p/thoughts_on_indicators_for_enemies_with_90_ult/,15,2025-03-27 17:12:38,"I was just thinking of how there is no way to know when enemies have their ultimates besides ""it's been way too long, surely they have it by now"". What if you could tell when an enemy has their ultimate or is really close?

Use cases:

You could know when it's safe to charge a Mei without her freezing your whole team.

You could know to not try to finish a critical HP enemy off when Ana is glowing.

You could stop gambling on whether the enemy Reaper is jumping into the fight out of stupidity or with an ult bomb.

You could try to separate from your teammates when Tracer is about to throw a bomb.

A bunch of ultimates give you decently fair warning, like Sigma's, Wrecking Ball's, Illari's, while other ultimates are (nearly) instant, and in many cases, unavoidable to someone playing without expecting one to appear, such as Reaper's, Pharah's, Zenyatta's, Ana's... besides tiny shifts in playstyle and/or positioning, you don't know when they're coming.

Personally, I think it would make the game *more* skillful and *more* strategic if you could see when an ultimate is coming, because it would be more about taking precautions and less about gambling on if they're dumb/bluffing or about to wipe your team.

Ultimates that take a while to start like Sigma's could start sooner now that he is shining yellow (or whatever the indicator may be) and you have warning already.

Another thing, you still wouldn't know if the ultimate is quite ready or not. You can have a choice of either going all out and killing them before they fully charge ult, or retreating and preparing for the ult.

Or, alternatively, what if it was only for 100% charged ults? Or what if there were distinguishable indicators for both 'almost ready' and 'fully ready' enemies?

And what about passives for this? One that lets certain heroes see 80%+ or 85%+ charged ults? If this isn't a feature by default: one that distinguishes 'almost ready' and 'fully ready' indication? One that gives you bonus ult charge for damaging/killing enemies nearly/fully ready? Perks that do similar things?

Obviously it wouldn't be immediately balanced either. The number would change and passives/perks, if existing, would too shift accordingly over time.

P.S: Please be civil in the comments. I just want a discussion about this feature that I've been thinking about recently and that I currently believe would be good for the game. I'm open to convincing arguments and counterpoints, or further agreement.

Freja is just a budget Sojourn,Overwatch,0,1jj6o32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1jj6o32/freja_is_just_a_budget_sojourn/,5,2025-03-25 01:27:23,"Generally OW releases new characters in a pretty strong state... To make a point of how insanely busted Sojourn still is today, lets take a look at a the new character Freja in comparison to Sojourn.

1. Mobility is very similar between the two. I would argue that Sojurn's is overall better because its both horizontal and vertical mobility in the same button. Freja gets two ""dashes"" but with a perk Sojourn gets two slides...and her slide is overall fairly similar distance to two dashes from Freja . Freja's hover mechanic is more of a liability than anything because of how much her movement is slowed, but Sojourn can still stay mobile and right click after sliding and jumping.

2. Freja's right click doesnt need charged and it isnt nearly as powerful as Sojourns. Its a projectile so long range shots are not trivial, and its damage cant one shot a character. Sojourn right click will have a little bit more downtime than Freja's because it needs to charge, but thats not really the major issue with Soj's kit...its the one shot hitscan across the map.

3. Freja's ult is pretty good, but its fairly short duration and doesnt need to be respected as much as Sojourns. Overclock lasts quite a long time and one shots squishies, while Freja's feels more like a way to confirm kills.

I think Freja is a better character for the heath of the game overall than Sojourn or Widow. Freja's right click reminds me of the event where Widow had a shoot -> delay -> extreme damage effect. If they want Widow and Sojourn to remain how they are, then I would expect some power creep where Freja's right click would do considerable more damage in exchange for less mobility. I think it would be better to tune Widow and Sojourn down instead...I think she is fun to play, but balance wise I guess lets see what they do for her on release."

Symmetre power budget comes from teleporting imobile heroes to the enemy backline (in theroy) but in pratice Sym teleport is always ignored by my team even I try cimmunicating about (They at max take the first tp) 

I suggest alowing only Sym to take her own tp at the cost of minor health and dmg buff 

- +25 Shield (in line with Torb, Reaper and Mei) 
- +2/5/10 Beam damage (In line with Zarya but Sym still has less range than a tank with no defensive CD) 

For the Ulti - Her ult feels like a rushed asset, she needs a Area Denial Ult Even a Small ulti shaped like a Box would be better for her 

For perks 

All the first ones are fine 

The Shield Battery needs a small change 
Instead of giving Sym a small buff for standing near the teleporter the perk should give Sym Shield each time she interacts with the tp for something like 40 Shield"
adding the perks system to comp makes comp feel even more complex then it already was and thats not a good thing when considering they are adding new heroes too..,Overwatch,0,1jiapad,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1jiapad/adding_the_perks_system_to_comp_makes_comp_feel/,13,2025-03-23 22:46:48,"i took a long break from overwatch after playing consistently since ow1 launch, and tbh the perks added to comp was a bad idea, because it just makes everyone way to unpredictable to track and theres no sense of balance, its ruined comp for me personally. it feels incredibly gimmicky and not a place for comp. at this point they are throwing shit to the wall and seeing what sticks but hopefully they remove this asap. comp in high ranks were already quite complex in many different ways but now we have to worry about perks smh. its way to hard to track, time to not play this game anymore again."
Why does the current 6V6 competitive test not use the exact same balance as the previous tests?,Overwatch,2,1jgt7vp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1jgt7vp/why_does_the_current_6v6_competitive_test_not_use/,3,2025-03-21 23:19:35,"I'm not really referring to the health pool stuff, because yes that is the same for tanks as previous tests, but they made such a big deal out of the separate balance for 6v6 compared to 5v5 (reverting Roadhog, Rein losing 1 fire streak and getting 2000 HP shield, etc) but now every hero is just their 5v5 versions plopped into 6v6.

I wanted him to feel more unique amongst the heroes though, so I'm gonna be focusing on that and less on balance. So just warning you now none of this is probably balanced, but it's the kit I'm more worried about.

New Support Hero: Shui

General:

\- Health: 225

\- Movement Speed: 5.5m/s

Passive: Tide

Shui's Abilities don't use cooldowns. Instead, they each require Tide to cast. Shui generates Tide passively, as well as by dealing damage to enemies with his Primary Fire.

If Shui completely drains his Tide, his abilities are put on a cooldown until he has the respective Tide to cast them.

\- Max Tide: 150

\- Tide Regeneration (Passive): 10/second

\- Tide Generation (Damage): 10 per instance of damage

Primary Fire: Water Bolt

Shui swings his staff, firing blasts of water at range, dealing damage to enemies. Water Bolts phase through all allies, applying a small heal over time effect that refreshes with additional applications, but doesn't stack with itself.

Water Bolt is considered a Melee Attack, if the enemy is within 6m of Shui.

\- Ammo: N/A

\- Attack Speed: 1 swing every 0.8 seconds

\- Damage (Staff): 25

\- Damage (Projectile): 45

\- Projectile Speed: 60m/s

\- Projectile Size: 0.2m

\- Projectile Size (Ally): 0.25m

\- Healing: 6 HP/s

\- Healing Duration: 6 seconds

Secondary Fire: Ocean's Boon

Shui creates a bubble of water around an ally, or himself by holding the selected binding, granting the target a Health Shield and a small heal over time. The strength of the Shield scales with the target's Max Health, before applying Health Modifiers. Allies who have been affected by Ocean's Boon cannot be affected by it again for a short time. The healing triples if an ally is below 30% of their Max Health.

Whilst protected by the bubble, the target takes reduced Fire Damage.

\- Range: 25m or Personal

\- Healing: 15 HP/s

\- Healing Duration: 5 seconds (Persisting after Bubble's destruction)

\- Shielding: 60 + 10% of Max Health

\- Shield Duration: 5 seconds or until destroyed

\- Target Cooldown (On Ability End): 5 seconds

\- Damage Mitigation (Vs. Fire): 25%

\- Tide Cost: 40

Ability 1: Upsurge

Shui propels himself forward with slight verticality, creating a splash of water where he launches himself and where he lands, dealing damage and slowing enemies hit where he leaps, and dealing the same damage and slow again where he lands, in addition to knocking up enemies.

\- Movement Speed: +100%

\- Jump Angle: 45°

\- Damage: 50

\- Slow: 30%

\- Duration (Knock Up): 0.5 seconds

\- Tide: 60

Ability 2: Sea Snares

Shui creates a slow moving bubble, throwing it out in front of him. After a short delay, the bubble arms itself, homing in on the first enemy that comes into range, dealing damage and Banishing them, making them untargetable by enemy or ally, and preventing them from attacking or using abilities. Shui can have 2 Sea Snares out at any time.

Allies can also interact with the bubbles, granting them the effects of Ocean's Boon when collected. This doesn't trigger Ocean's Boon's target cooldown.

\- Range (Travel Distance): 12m

\- Projectile Speed: 20m/s

\- Range (Enemy Lock): 5m of a bubble

\- Banish Duration: 1 second

\- Bubble Lifetime: 10 seconds

\- Damage: 50

\- Tide: 40

Ultimate Ability: Riptide

Shui briefly channels, creating a large dome of water, pulling all nearby enemies into it, damaging them and applying a decaying slowing. Shui then dives into the dome, becoming Unstoppable during the dive, before rapidly swimming around the bubble, dealing repeated damage to all enemies in the water. Whilst submerged, Shui gains additional Overhealth and takes reduced damage whilst he has it. After a short time, Shui condenses the dome of water into a spout, swimming up the spout before leaping out of it, sending all enemies in range flying away from him, dealing the same damage and slow again. Allies in range of the blast are healed, gain a powerful Shield and take reduced damage whilst they have it. Shui can cancel Riptide early, at the cost of weakening the water spout's damage and effects. Shui loses all remaining Overhealth upon ending Riptide.

After leaving Riptide, Shui's abilities don't consume Tide for 6 seconds.

\- Ultimate Cost: 2,850

\- Cast Time: 1.2 seconds

\- Range: 12.5m

\- Damage: 50

\- Damage (Inside): 10/second

\- Duration: 8 seconds

\- Slow: 60-30%

\- Healing (Shui): 300 Overhealth

\- Damage Mitigation: 40%

\- Healing: 250

\- Shielding: 120 + 10% of Max Health

\- Shield Duration: 6 seconds

\- Damage Mitigation: 20%

\- Knockback Speed (Spout): 11m/s

\- Spout Strength (On early end): -50%

Perks:

Level 2:

River's Rebuke:

Upsurge now grants Shui a Shield of 50 + 5% of his Max Health before leaping; upon landing, the Shield explodes, dealing an additional 30 damage when he lands and reduces the damage affected enemies deal by 15% for 3 seconds.

Silent Depths:

Ocean's Boon can now target enemies. Enemies take 15 damage per second for 5 seconds and are Silenced for 2 seconds. Casting Ocean's Boon on an enemy increases it's Tide cost by 20%.

Level 3:

Atlas of the Yellow River:

Upsurge now creates a stream of water behind Shui as he travels, granting all allies +15% Movement Speed and heals them for 10 HP/s and slowing enemies by 25% when standing in the water. The stream lasts for 5 seconds; only one stream can be active at a time.

Deep Sea Snares:

Sea Snares no longer home in on enemies, nor Banish them, but their deploy range is increased by 50% and their projectile speed is tripled. Sea Snares now deal 20 True Damage to enemies over 4 seconds, ignoring any and all damage reducing effects on the target, and deal their damage over time, increasing by 4% for each tick of damage received. Kills with Sea Snares restore 15 Tide.

*Just want to reiterate again this is just for fun, balance not really being taken into consideration, so don't take these numbers too seriously. They're simply there to serve as guidelines for what Aqua's abilities do and how they work. And if anything on here is at all similar to Aqua's actual kit, it's purely coincidental, as his release is in June 2025 and this post was made in March 2025.*"

Then Zarya, as a support main watching any tank try to have fun and play anything into Zarya is depressing. They have to insta switch just to stand a chance. I’m yet to win a game into Zarya when our tank was anything else. 

The devs can be so good with noticing things and so oblivious, it’s like they have two separate balance change teams and neither of them actually play the game. 

Also can we talk about Ana… as a lifeweaver main, my major perk is to add 30 healing every 5 seconds by forcing me to use my self-heal/mobility cd, it’s so bad! The perk system is fun don’t get me wrong but they’re so unbelievably skewed into heroes that were already very strong.

OW2 6v6 Comp Open Queue..,Overwatch,0,1jemu40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1jemu40/ow2_6v6_comp_open_queue/,11,2025-03-19 03:25:44,Soooo.. UMMM… what am I playing?!? They gave us a 6v6 retrofit that feels like 5+1 Vs 5+1. There was no balancing done specifically for this test. We are playing on the foundation of 5v5. The S9 changes which aren’t good for 6v6. Perks are way way too much for 6v6 in this state. The characters made for 5v5 not 6v6. The laziness is unreal. You locked 2 tanks but no other roles? So now we have giga Chad 4 supports with 2 tanks. Also everything the player base ask for to be fixed with 6v6 wasn’t even corrected for the test. Like at this point I’m completely losing all hope for this game. All we want is 6v6 before 5v5 was made. Fix the tank issue. Put the new game modes in and make all the new characters work with 6v6.  The foundation of 5v5 works because it’s made for 5v5. Counter swapping is annoying as hell and will never be fixed and you will never have 6v6 unless you revert all changes of 5v5 and fix the internal tank issue. It’s not hard. Sorry if this sounds little like a rant but it’s a joke at this point.

I'm really enjoying OW again, but seriously, what does is the balance team cooking? Even if they are going purely off win rates, which is a stupid balance philosophy, surely at least Ana is going crazy in low ranks too?

Is it possible to make the current maps breakable on some walls etc.  (Not total overhaul of game)

2. -- Is it possible to mirror the payload maps? --

So, Players go the reverse direction with Payload;
 It would play differently.


3. --we Need to be paid with more token$ for Losing in Competitive!!--

This game has made me Sick (literally);
 After 45 minutes, and  a lost match in overtime.

why did one of my teammates ""leave""? when, 
""we are winning"" in those extra rounds.)


**The one(1) point of 30 points**  system

 The ONLY reason-I didn't stop playing years ago. 

 Issue is:
 Max out to the system is at 3k comp points, so after the Max

""I'm Done""  until next season. 


4. --Also!--add a way to earn more retro comp points--

Point system like:  Lose=10,  tie=25.  50 for win. 


So what, if everyone has a Gold nowadays, 

Players enjoy the characters more with weapon skins and grinding to goals. 
 
The prestige of owning gold,  isn't as spectacular as it was so many years ago?!

""Value Players time""(musk). 

Value my time.  
Because a game over 30 mins and a

6. --please look at your matchmaker again, because it still isn't ""fair""--

 I'm ""supposed""  to heal and save the noobs; nope, not me anymore. Too many games and years of nursing.  

I actually like playing support for ""non"" -Bots! 

  Now playing  for the loot boxes and stop playing until the next week.  So that's my time into it.
  Comp playlist until get my loot boxes; done.
The new Camo,  not worth the time of 
[1/30] and over 300 games. 

--Perks had me check out the game again--

The Halloween event had meaningful changes. 

What happened,  got scared that the Balancing would be off?
Ok,  make it a separate list.
(Because, yes the game wasn't built around perks)

-- tell me, is it a penalty to counter swap?!?--  (to have to wait to get perks again or Chose wrong one perks?!)--



--Last 7--,  punishment for leaving is stupid: 

 ""not having to play more of the game;

I was wrong about perks,Overwatch,1,1j78c84,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1j78c84/i_was_wrong_about_perks/,14,2025-03-09 15:06:12,"When perks dropped I made a post venting my frustrations with the new system. Having played the game much more since then, I'll admit I was (mostly) wrong. I still maintain that some of the perks are ridiculously unbalanced and that overall it's going to be a nightmare for the team to balance in the future, but I really don't hate it as much as I did on launch. It definitely takes some getting used to (I still freeze up for a moment whenever I unlock my perks) but I really don't mind it that much aside from that. 

  
Assuming perks get balanced in some way and the system gets tweaked a little bit I don't think I'll stop playing Overwatch because of it. I'm relieved to be able to play the game without feeling *too* disillusioned. I still think it was wild to shove perks straight into comp without a grace period to get used to them, but we're all in the same boat on that I suppose.

Changes/Addictions I would like to see,Overwatch,1,1j5kxcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1j5kxcg/changesaddictions_i_would_like_to_see/,3,2025-03-07 11:58:20,"This is not about balance, just changes that might improve the user experience focused on the more casual players.

-Free lootbox for playing the least played role
Like it was before Overwatch 2. Now we get 500xp, which is basically nothing. And now that lootboxes are back, this feature might as well get reimplemented.

-“Classic” skins for every OW1 hero gets their old spawn/select voice line. E.g. D.va: “I play to win!” DF: “Only through conflict do we evolve” etc.
Gives more reason to select those skins and it would be a nice throwback. And we know this should be relatively easy to implement since OW Classic used these voice lines as well.

-Perks in “While you wait”
When your queueing for a game and you enter Skirmish or Deathmatch you should start at Perk lv3. So you can try them out against other players while waiting for your next loss in Comp :wink:

-Perks in Deathmatch
I was really surprised to see that they aren’t available here. Might be because of balance, since some perks are useless without a team. But the same is mostly true right now for certain characters (Mercy).

-Assault/2CP back in QP map pool
Because Clash was removed from Comp I see no reason to not add them back to QP as well.
OW Classic made me realise that I missed those maps and playing them every now and then isn’t so bad. Matches on those maps usually don’t last that long anyway, so they are easy points towards weekly challenges. And since map votes will be coming people who don’t like them could always vote for other maps. Also, it would be the first time we can properly test them in a 5v5 1-2-2 format.

What do you think of my suggestion? What would you like to see?"

Ana, the most played hero in the game, gets to have game changingly powerful cooldowns, no damage falloff, etc. For years, players have addressed this problem by solo ulting the enemy Ana at least 4 times a game, and when not available, immediately throwing themselves at her the moment she uses her abilities.

However, recently there has been a change that threatens the careful balance of this ecosystem, I recently watched a typical interaction, Reaper flanks and tries to kill Ana. However unlike the typical situation where Ana falls over and order is restored to the world, instead Ana said to Reaper (and I may be misquoting this) ""PICK A GOD AND PRAY"" and immediately killed him. The thread of prophecy completely shattered. I was devastated at this genuine and obvious injustice.

Something must be done about these so called ""perks"" that Ana is ""using"" or the game as we know it will collapse. I believe this is the first horseman of the balance apocalypse. "

Better Genji Perks,Overwatch,0,1j2thw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1j2thw0/better_genji_perks/,1,2025-03-03 22:08:37,"(Season 1 2016 Genji main Silver - GM) I think I have some pretty cool and balanced perks for genji figured out that I want to share. 

#1 Genji Perk: Duel Weilding
Enables empowered melee during Dragon Blade. 
(This acts as a new burst combo option that doesn't ruin the whole ult if you miss it)

Also, melee internal cool down adds natural counterplay to genjis deflect because using the melee gives the enemy a free ""he can't deflect"" moment.

I never wanted flaster sword swings. Give me cool ninja sword combos instead.

#2 Genji Perk: ""something worth picking over life steal blade""
Cyborg Upgrade: genji receives a solo play care package. Swift Stike and Wall Climb both reset your Double Jump and convert 75hp into shield health.

This combo of minor quality of life buffs will help genji in comps when your healers can't or don't help you, or you need to survive in their back line on your own. 

duel flyers, and or improve your ability to get on the back line without burning your major cool downs on specific maps that are harder to flank on.
Also, OW Classic Genji had the wall climb jump reset, bring it back please 🙏 

#3 Genji Perk: Hunters Mark
Swift strike deals 50 damage, at a slower rate, over a longer period of time. Enemies marked are revealed through walls like sombra.

(Long gone are the days of moiras, silently coming out of fade with no audio queue and getting lost in Narnia. YOU TOO, can now follow up your own engagement with THIS, the FIRST EVER CASE of DLC privilege for genji. "
Changes to make perks better,Overwatch,0,1j2ah7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1j2ah7w/changes_to_make_perks_better/,9,2025-03-03 05:26:21,"I just got around to playing the new update, and I think the perks are a neat addition. However, it has been poorly implemented. I typically hover in a Gold range on comp, but I mostly play casual because I just like to have fun. Without getting into which ones are more powerful than others, I think there are some changes that could drastically help. 

* Bounty System: Perks make the game play more like a MOBA with a level system and items. As a result, a bounty system can help. Sometimes it sucks to just get the short end of the stick in a match, and a bounty system when someone has more perks or a higher killstreak can certainly help balance that out. Also in casual, sometimes you just want to play worse characters because they are fun. This helps balance them out as well.
* In control, each round should reset the in-game xp and reset perks. The great thing about control is taking that second to reset, pick a new character that works better on the map, and continue. Perks discourage this.
* Do not reset perk progress to level 1. Instead, it should be partially depleted. The thing is, Overwatch is a hero shooter, not a MOBA. Resetting the progress completely discourages switching at all, and makes it play a lot more like a MOBA."
Making Ramattra’s minor perks less one sided,Overwatch,0,1j0noiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1j0noiu/making_ramattras_minor_perks_less_one_sided/,4,2025-03-01 02:14:38,"I don’t know if this is the unanimous opinion with Ramattra players but it feels like Void Surge is minor perks people choose 99% of the time. It’s just extra dps on your primary, whereas with Prolonged Barrier it just keeps your shield up for an additional second more or less. 
So I have suggestion that I’ve been thinking of (wouldn’t be surprised if others had the same or similar idea), to make both of the minor perks feel impactful instead of 1 obvious choice. Instead of making the barrier last longer, what if the minor perk gave you more control over your shield? Functioning like Sigma’s barrier, acting more like a resource rather than a cooldown. To compensate I wouldn’t mind if the health went down from 1,000 to say 600-700 to put in line with Sigma or Orisa (who also has a perk that gives her a flexible shield).
This would make Ram’s 2 minor perks an actual decision to take into consideration depending on your playstyle, your/the enemy team comp, or map. You want to play more aggressively? Pick Void Surge for the additional projectiles to add to your dps. Want to play more defensive or give you options rather than play block simulator while a Mauga shoots at you when you’re in Nemesis? Go with the new barrier perk that you can deploy and retract at will. 

I’m not too sure if this idea is entirely balanced, or if this perk replacement would even fit as a minor perk given how much it changes Ram. But to me at least it would already go a long way in making Ram’s perks feel like a real choice. 
I love playing Ramattra and I’ve had this idea in my head ever since he came out. But I want to know what other people think of this idea. Is it too much? Would you still prefer Void Surge if my idea got implemented? I’d like to see your opinions."

Minor perks:

Dramatic Entrance: create an instant blast of 50 healing and damage in a small radius around you after leaving Fade.

Shifting Weight: If Coalescense affects both an ally and enemy at once, the ally gains increased movement speed and the enemy moves slower.

Major perks:

Balance: Biotic Orb becomes half as effective but can hold two charges and has its cooldown reduced by 60%.

Fulfilling Chaos: healing an ally damages nearby enemies, and damaging enemies heals nearby allies.

SET 2:

Minor perks:

Impatient Explosion: Activate Biotic Orb again while it's already active to explode it for 75% of its remaining effect.

Haunting: Fading through teammates grants them 30 temporary overhealth and Fading through enemies poisons them for 30 damage over 5 seconds

Major Perks:

Desperate Clinging: Biotic Orb weakly orbits targets under 60% max HP. (isn't strong enough to do a full orbit if the target stands still, so enemies can fling it off and allies can get more use out of it by paying attention) [Maybe unbalanced IMO]

Why is the Default to Nerf OP Characters,Overwatch,0,1izvme0,https://i.redd.it/ep1uh0d34sle1.jpeg,15,2025-02-28 02:01:09,"Why is the default reaction when facing a character that is deemed as OP to nerf them? I personally think that maybe buffing other characters without nerfing the op ones could do a better job of balancing the game overall, cause if every character has something that is op about them I think that will lead to some more ranged picks especially in comp. You can kinda start to see that with the introduction of perks. Let me know your thoughts."
how would you change at least 2 of your mains perks?,Overwatch,0,1iyqmd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1iyqmd5/how_would_you_change_at_least_2_of_your_mains/,16,2025-02-26 16:51:14,"I don't care if you like them how they are, you need to change them, while keeping it balanced. Can be big or small.

For me, my main is soldier. 

I would make agility let him run in all directions, not just forward, but at a reduced speed bonus from forward. I would also make agility automatically start you reloading if your gun is not full, just something to make me think about less in a match.

I would fully change stim pack. instead, it would big increase the size of biotic field, and everyone in it gains a much smaller version of stim pack, without anti heal.

I would change the 1st perk biotic field to just heal teammates a bit faster in general

I like the rocket one, but if I was forced to change it, make rockets weaker, but the cooldown is 1/4 the time and can be held

The second idea I had seems like it needs work, so any ideas would also be nice. "

Tracer perks needs changes... And I have some ideas.,Overwatch,0,1iwb6gg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1iwb6gg/tracer_perks_needs_changes_and_i_have_some_ideas/,1,2025-02-23 15:21:33,"Listen, I love our hyperactive time traveler, she's the hardest character in the game, and I understand that mastering her deserves results.

But there's a little problem with Tracer's perks in that they dumb down her skill ceiling, so I would like to propose some changes to some perks to fix this problem:

For the LvL 2 perks: 

- When Tracer takes a health pack, she recovers a Blink... This is OK, it is if anything a quality of life change as a flanker.
-  The perk that increases the radius of pulse bomb is gonne, now killing an enemy grants Tracer the effects of the old DPS passive, and she reloads faster during 2 or 3 seconds.

Why?

Honestly, Pulse Bomb is supposed to be balanced around the fact that being as hard as it it to use, is the quickest ultimate you can get in the game... I don't consider a good change to just make it easier to use...  And giving Tracer faster reload times gives her a more distinct effect while being a nice reference to the old passives.

For the LvL 3 Perks:
- Tracer recovers all her blinks when she recalls... But now there's a catch... For every blink she recovers, the next cooldown of Recall increases in one extra second, to a Max of 3 seconds.
- When Tracer recalls... She gains temporary health when reappearing... But now how much health she gets depends on the DISTANCE she traveled from the point she recalled to the point of origin. The less distance, the less over health she gets. (if you don't move at all during recall, no over health for you.) 

Why?

I think Tracer having strong perks like this isn't inherently bad, the thing that makes Perks so fun to me is that they're based on the old Overwatch days of ""better crazy even if a little broken"".

But there's some perks that are so damn good... In this second case, instead of just nerfing them... I tried to give them a twist by making them more hard to get value from them, as Tracer is supposed to be like.

I would love to hear your opinion about this, or other ideas you have!

Spitballing alternative Genji perks,Overwatch,0,1iw10vl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1iw10vl/spitballing_alternative_genji_perks/,3,2025-02-23 04:38:10,"I honestly think Genji's perks suck. I'm no Genji main, but they feel entirely irrelevant to his playstyle. So if you're a Genji main (or not) spitball some ideas that would actually fit Genji's playstyle.

## **Major Perks:**

1. **Absorption**  
   *Deflecting 70 or more damage instantly recharges Swift Strike.*

2. **Perfected Technique**  
   *Projectiles that are deflected automatically return to the enemy, but their damage is reduced by 50%.*

3. **Brute Force**  
   *Swift Strike deals 30 additional damage but has 40% less range.*

4. **Rejuvenating Slash**  
   *Activating Dragonblade fully heals Genji and grants him 30% lifesteal while the ultimate is active.*

## **Minor Perks:**

1. **Bloodthirst**  
   *Swift Strike grants 80% lifesteal.*

2. **Adaptation**  
   *Deflecting converts 50% of the damage into overhealth, up to a maximum of 90 overhealth. This overhealth decays after 7 seconds.*

3. **Dragon's Breath**  
   *Swift Strike deals an additional 50 damage over 3 seconds.*

4. **Dragon Zeal**  
   *Each successful slash with Dragonblade extends the ultimate’s duration by 0.5 seconds. Dragonblade’s swing speed is increased by 35%.*

These aren't mean to be perfectly balanced, I just want to give him something so he doesn't feel so useless. Blizz doesn't seem to understand how Genji players actually play.

For Ramattra his nemesis form doesnt need much changes to be balanced as a infinite duration form and currently with perks feels underpowered in some cqc situations because omnic form just flat out has more damage output than nemesis form. Only change it really needs to work as a low/no cooldown ability is to keep the extra 300 armor he gets as a seperate health that gets disabled in omnic form.

But for Bastion he needs an all over rework for it to work with infinite duration transform. First off he needs to generaly have is assault form to be designed for close to mid range engagements while his scout form should be designed for mid range and bit further. A permanent assault form could be balanced with less damage output and needing the help of critical hits to reach higher damage outputs. Not having infinite ammo would be there to control the damage output too. Scout form could use a bit more damage at range since at range it does minimal damage where other heroes could out damage you without much effort.

Its hard to talk about the balance of it all, but in terms of being able to know what's going on, some perks are just better than others. 

When Orisa shoots down a shield, you can see the shield. You know she has the shield perk. It kind of speaks for itself. 

When you see Torb torb throwing turrets against the ceiling, again, it speaks for itself. You only need to see a turret against a wall once to know that Torb can throw turrets against walls. 

Sojourn getting 15 extra ammo... You don't really see that, as an opponent. I mean, I guess you can notice it, if you're looking out for it, but yeah. 

I think perks would be great if all of them had clear-as-day effects. You shouldn't need to open the scoreboard to see what perks your enemies have, you should be able to quickly and easily see the effects of their perks, even if they pick those perks mid fight. "

& communities):

-Tracer's obviously need nerfs (really funny that even their own reddit are saying it feels wrong to be this op).

-Sombra obviously needs new ones (saw many agreeing that choosing no major perk is often ideal to preserve both hack range & ease of hack targeting in fights).

-Symmetra's appear impactful to the reader but 3/4 are worthless to actual Sym players 

(extra sentry doesn't make sentries good, 
tp range doesn't change her inability to 1v1 even supports, 
beam range only increases once you have charged it in close range so it's like a win-more,
regening shields equal to half a melee every sec if tp stays alive is very minor but is a 'major' perk).


Honorable mentions: Ash's will probably need nerfs.
Moira's will probably need buffs.

Agree/disagree? Anything else extreme that l forgot?

early thoughts on the perk system,Overwatch,1,1iun3dl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1iun3dl/early_thoughts_on_the_perk_system/,7,2025-02-21 10:35:30,"Hey all,

I just wrote a rather chunky analysis as a reply to someone that said they noticed people counterswapping a lot less. My reply got so long i thought it would probably warrant its own post at this point. I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts on this.

My reply:

Your observation is absolutely correct though; people are very noticeably swapping a lot less. From what I’m seeing, people often try to make it work with their initially preferred hero and then spec them into a direction that better suits the match than trying to constantly counterswap. But perhaps a bigger win is that people now seem to understand that playing the map and (simple) changes in how you play absolutely can make a ton of difference.

There’s still one glaring problem: some perks are much more powerful than others. And not just that: some heroes have a collection of random perks that really don’t have a lot of symbiosis either with each other while other heroes can actually make builds that greatly change their gameplay. Imo this last point is what we need for all heroes. The perk system is a good start, but so far from what I’ve seen, we’re going to need more direction and intent in what perks heroes get and we really need to get rid of the ‘free value without gameplay changes’ options; they’re boring and they don’t bring anything meaningful to the table. 

For example, I’ve been playing exclusively bastion since the release of s15, mostly because I never really feel like I’m forced to swap. There’s always something i can do with perks to make bastion at least viable. So far I’ve identified two builds for bastion: sniperbot and brawlbot. Sniperbot is really good against other snipers and gives bastion the chance to pressure from longe ranges while still being vulnerable to divers and flankers. For Sniperbot you choose smart bomb and lindholm explosives.

There’s also brawlbot. For brawlbot you choose armored artillery and self heal. Brawlbot emphasizes bastion’s brawlbreaking capabilities while also making him much more durable against flankers and divers - but not against snipers and burst damage. Brawlbot is a bit harder to pull off well, but the main mechanic is that self heal gives a ton of ult charge and ulting gives you 650 hp. You can pick smart bomb to turn it into flankbot instead.

As you can see, bastion actually has two/three builds that makes it so he can adapt to many different situations that he’s originally very weak against: snipers and divers. But in order to extract the full value of the build you need to adapt your gameplay, and that is why i think Bastion’s perks are (for now) pretty close to the gold standard for what perks should feel like and what they should do.

If you want sniperbot to work, you need to leverage your range advantage and stay further away from the fight. Similarly with brawlbot: if you want it to work, you actually need to be in a place where you can take damage in a controlled manner. To do that you need cover and your team to protect you. The balance is pretty hard to pin down and im honestly still learning brawlbot. Bad plays become much more obvious and i feel like the game now actually tells me what i did wrong and how i can improve.

Sorry for the long ramble, it kinda just came out, but to go back to your observation: I really think that putting the focus on building your hero well instead of counterswapping is a much more skillful and long term much healthier direction for the game."

But I was thinking… This system gave, at least for me, a breath of fresh air into this game and I think they can actually improve.

One thing that I've thought could be a nice feature is: they could implement for exemple 5 minor and 5 major perks (the thing is add options) for each character in the character page, we would have to select between 2 major and 2 minor. I Think this way this system could be super flexible and adapt to each person… for exemple: Sombra has a major perk that consists of giving an ally a healing hack, what if I don't want that and instead I could put another offensive major perk, so when i upgrade in the game i could have a different one instead of the healing hack?

I think this would be nice thinking about longevity because someday we are probably gonna be tired of the same ones over and over again.

And plus… they have actually a lot of different perks mainly with the content we're gonna get with the stadium mode.

I just can’t say I’m happy about it. 6v6 is already special, it never needed this schlock.

I’m posting to see if I’m crazy. I get that perks are mostly a hit with the casual audience, and that’s cool. Ijust have an issue when 6v6 needs months of testing, but this perk shit goes straight into competitive day 1. It is obviously not balanced, it belongs in a limited time mode or quick play. 

Personally I don’t like perks. I like Overwatch with simple kits interacting together in interesting ways. The game is hard to track already, we don’t need skill trees to track as well.

"Thoughts on smurfing, and perks",Overwatch,0,1irhlrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1irhlrq/thoughts_on_smurfing_and_perks/,20,2025-02-17 12:16:39,"People who smurf, I think, generally fall into two categories,

1. People who enjoy winning

2. People who enjoy playing with friends differently ranked friends

For the first set, we can't really do much, except adjust their mmr such that it moves to a higher level quicker and stays there while disregarding throwing attempts. I was glad when they announced recently that new accounts would have their mmr adjusted quicker if the player shows that they're experienced and not totally new players. It shows that they have ways of identifying good players, so handling smurfs should not be a big problem either.

For the second set, I feel that they would be less incentivize to create new accounts to smurf if there was a way to balance the matches even when they're on their original mmr account. I know Overwatch tries to match similar skill levels on both teams. But it still makes the experience unpleasant for the weaker players on both teams. What if handicaps are added to better players (or buffs given to weaker players) instead?

Finding a balance would be tough, but I think the new perks system is a good starting point. Allow weaker players to gain perks quicker than stronger players. For example, a bronze player should get their 2nd perk before a gm player gets their first perk. 

This would be opposite of what I've been hearing how perks work. Apparently, it's like gaining ult charge, where the more healing or damage, the more ult charge, and also faster perk gains. I'm not sure if this works out better than the halloween event way where everyone gains perks at the same rate (aka after every round). I felt like that event balanced the playing field better, and made games more enjoyable.

I really enjoy playing more or less balanced games rather than one-sided wins or losses. Not sure about everyone else though..

Edit: People commenting abt other reasons, but whatever the exact reason, one just wants to smurf, but the other can't help but smurf to achieve what they want. So, I'm wondering if there are ways to solve the problem for the 2nd group of people. Whether it's queue time, teaming up with friends or anything else aside from styling on weaker players.

The fact that Jay3 has made a few videos of high ranked vs low ranked players show that it is possible for people of different ranks to play and have fun together. For example, there was a buffed Aspen (top 500 support) vs a group of bronze players. Or gold vs master with master losing a player each time they win. Or 2 buffed bronze vs 10 nerfed GM players.

Note: I don't consider unranked to GM smurfing, unless it's bronze to GM. It's all fair game, and Overwatch alr said they'll adjust them quicker than newer players. "
Should open queue become the “main” 6v6 mode?,Overwatch,0,1ircwps,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1ircwps/should_open_queue_become_the_main_6v6_mode/,16,2025-02-17 06:48:23,"Hey everyone, with them experimenting with 6v6 in the next update and onward, wouldn’t it better if 5v5 open queue is just replaced with 6v6 and they balance it around being open queue? The want for 6v6 comes from a fairly fundamental “return to formula” for many people. I think this would make a good balance for the game. 5v5 is role queue, giving a more “balanced” experience. But open queue gives you that freedom many players are looking for in the game, hell sometimes I jump on open queue just to have a good time. You should honestly try it sometime and just enjoy it. 

However, if anyone here likes 5v5 open queue, please speak up and tell me if you would hate this. open queue has always been fairly scuffed and looked down on by the greater community, I think this would give it a good difference.

Conversely, what about you guys who want a 6v6 role queue, do you think it could exist without overtaking the main 5v5 format of the game? My idea with this is that it wouldn’t overtake the 5v5 format for the developers, since they are so attached to it. But it could also add a spice to open queue so it isnt just that scuffed clusterfuck, that’s terribly balanced btw. Some tanks in open queue are useless, while 2 tanks is always too strong in 5v5 open queue. Could balance it out tbh 

edit: oh yea, should add that perks actually fix a tom of issues with open queue. Feel like people will go on tank and support and actually stay on them since you have aggressive options for perks, or even defensive. Hell, even some utility too. Would incentive balanced teams "
'We should be a little scared of what we're putting out there': Overwatch 2 lead designer says hero perks are about 'letting go' of perfect balance,Overwatch,2490,1iq2xu6,https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/we-should-be-a-little-scared-of-what-were-putting-out-there-overwatch-2-lead-designer-says-hero-perks-are-about-letting-go-of-perfect-balance/,386,2025-02-15 15:50:41,
Overwatch 2 Perks Thoughts,Overwatch,0,1ipnrvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1ipnrvx/overwatch_2_perks_thoughts/,2,2025-02-15 00:11:40,"I can't wait to try out the new system as it will provide a fresh breath of air to the game. And whether if it is balanced or not, I just hope it can be fun.

THAT BEING SAID! After looking at the perks, I kinda feel like the perks feel.... inconsistent. For example, some heroes have the same perk, but under different orders (ie. Ram and Lifeweaver). Not to mention that some minor perks would be considered better than the character's majors (ie. many ultimate perks are minor perks)

As such, I kinda feel like they should look at re-organizing the perk system. After all, as they put it, ""minor perks are small upgrades to an ability, whereas major perks are more impactful upgrades that can change the functionality of the ability altogether.""

*That is why I believe that they should leave the minor perks for hero abilities. As for majors, place a juiced-up ultimate and new abilities/functions towards the hero's weapon (ie. Solider's Stim Pack and Ana/Juno's headshot potential)*

***Keep in mind, the system has not be released so these are just early impressions and can change overtime.***

Regardless, I am happy to see changes to the game, and I hope the devs listen to the feedback."
Do you think there will be a big balance patch with the new season?,Overwatch,2,1ipkhzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1ipkhzu/do_you_think_there_will_be_a_big_balance_patch/,2,2025-02-14 21:44:39,"I feel like we’ll see some adjustments as there’s always changes to be made, but how do you balance that alongside perks without much data across the ranks?"
Is Overwatch back with S15? Or just another failure?,Overwatch,0,1ipjkat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1ipjkat/is_overwatch_back_with_s15_or_just_another_failure/,50,2025-02-14 21:03:51,"I watched the *Overwatch Spotlight* video on YouTube live as it was released—just like many others, I’m sure. Perks, loot boxes, and hero portraits actually got me a bit hyped for Season 15.

What are your opinion? Is the *Overwatch* we loved truly back, or is this just another failure?

Personal thoughts:   
Right after the ""live stream,"" I opened the game and jumped into a few competitive matches. And that’s when I was reminded of why I quit a few seasons ago.

I’m not the best player and usually hover around the Diamond rank on all roles, but here’s how the game currently feels to me:

* Tanks are still raid bosses.
* DPSing is *okay-ish*.
* Supports have basically become the game's dedicated healers again.

It feels like the individual impact on a match’s outcome has shifted heavily towards certain roles, and honestly, that’s quite disheartening.   
From a balance perspective, I can imagine that implementing a consistent 20% personal impact per player in a 5v5 format is challenging, due to how many factors influence the outcome of a match.

If I remember correctly, before Season 9 - or in Overwatch 1 in general - I never felt like I had to try this hard compared to now.

So, all in all, I can’t imagine these new features will save the game unless the balance philosophy behind 5v5 changes—or they bring back 6v6."
Why does 6v6 need so many tests but perks are going to just be dropped immediately?,Overwatch,1287,1ip9zmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1ip9zmt/why_does_6v6_need_so_many_tests_but_perks_are/,498,2025-02-14 13:58:00,"I know a lot of people are excited for the more wacky perks to spice up gameplay but they’re not well balanced (double jump reset on dash or 30% lifesteal on blade is a no-brainer) or give insane sustain for already great characters. (giving tracer basically double blinks)

I’m just not sure why they didn’t test these to see if it wouldn’t break the game or even be fun to play against when that’s some of the reasons we’ve been having to do all these constant 6v6 tests. 

Edit: I did not know that perks had gotten feedback from other gamemodes like junkensteins lab, I mostly stick to comp. It’s reassuring to hear the feedback was pretty positive, I just hope they can balance these perk choices for a competitive environment when they’re still struggling with just the base kits."
It's Time to Bring Back Uppercut,Overwatch,0,1iouzut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1iouzut/its_time_to_bring_back_uppercut/,5,2025-02-13 23:08:16,"For background, I've been playing Overwatch since 2016-or-17, but I have not logged on to the game in months. That being said, I could not help but check out the new changes they are going to be implementing in Season 15 and Season 16. And I am impressed. Passives seem like an amazing idea, and balancing issues aside, ultimately what people want is a fun-to-play game, which sometimes means you have to introduce some crazy stuff. So it makes complete sense that they went all out with the passives.

But why not for Doomfist?

And before everyone starts screaming and pointing fingers, no this is not some secret conspiracy to undermine the Doomfist players, and it's childish to think so. The point of this essay isn't to trash on the devs for refusing to bring Uppercut back, but it is to **make some noise** due to the fact that it wasn't.

That being said. I think we have run out of excuses to not bring back the move, because we have a whole list of abilities/traits that were removed that are coming back to the game:

* Orisa Shield
* Rock stun scaling
* Lifeweaver drop
* Self-repair
* Tank form
* Swift Strike Bleed (and arguably double jump reset if we stretch it)
* **Scatter Arrow!!!!**
* Reaper Soul Globes
* Angelic Recovery

You cannot tell me with all the crazy abilities being brought back (going as far as Orisa shield/Scatter/Literally everything for Bastion), that we can't make an extension for Uppercut as well. The only question left, is how? Because now that Doomfist is in the tank role this would be a difficult task. Here are possible **Major Perks:**

* **Out-of-Block Options:** Reinputting Power Block allows you to perform an Uppercut (now cancelled by LMB). Slightly raises its cooldown.
* **Rise to Power:** Empowered fist changes Power Block into an Uppercut. (Does not cancel Power Block but allows you to reinput, once again).
* **All-In:** Replace Power Block with an Uppercut that grants bonus overhealth and avoids stuns. Hitting 2 or more enemies Empowers Rocket Punch.
   * This form of Rising Uppercut would be *very low* damage, but extra AoE.
   * Grants immediate overhealth on-use as well.
   * During the Uppercut, Doomfist gains CC immunity.

These are all ideas that allow Uppercut to be reintroduced while allowing for Doomfist to excel in his role as a Tank. Admittedly the last idea wasn't thought through very thouroughly, but these only serve as examples of what can be done.

Let me know what you guys think, and be sure to spread the word if you agree."
New Perk System,Overwatch,0,1iomiud,https://i.redd.it/9jrmqf8ikxie1.jpeg,3,2025-02-13 17:09:42,"Hi guys, what’s your opinion on the overwatch S15 new perk system?

For my own, it shouldn’t be in the comp immediately. Too many new things to memorize, and also doubted about the balancing of this perk.

Plz share ur ideas, just for discussion:)"
Perks seem amazingly cool but might be a balancing nightmare,Overwatch,2,1iohcls,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1iohcls/perks_seem_amazingly_cool_but_might_be_a/,10,2025-02-13 12:50:37,"I like many others, am super excited for the new perks. But I'm a little skeptical balancing wise.

Certain heros in the game right now I'd argue are pretty unhealthy for the game (Mauga) and giving them additional abilities or buffs might just make them less fun to against. So I'd say some heros will need serious reworks.

But otherwise I'm excited for the perks since it's almost like discovering the game for the first time again, trying to figure out what everyone can do and choosing what suits your play style best."
Balance issues in the Perks.,Overwatch,6,1ioenyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1ioenyi/balance_issues_in_the_perks/,20,2025-02-13 09:33:36,"I'm pretty optimistic with the perks but from what I've seen some heroes got mistreated quite badly when compared to others. Moira is the worst one I've seen.

  
So Ana's major perks either basically double Nano Boost's value, or change her playstyle quite drastically making her even better in Widow matchups. Baptiste gets an automated healing etc. But Moira gets a 50 health burst heal on heal orb or DPS passive effect on her damage orb... That's not fair nor balanced on paper. We'll see how it ends up working in the end.

  
Are there other examples of potential balance issues that people have noticed?"
Worried perks will kill competitive,Overwatch,22,1io2bi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1io2bi4/worried_perks_will_kill_competitive/,43,2025-02-12 22:29:35,"Am I the only one worried that the massive diversity and change with the perks will kill the potential for OW 2 to become a truly competitive game?

I feel like a big part of what is required for that competitive aspect is consistency and balance.

If you look at successful eSports in the FPS realm, Counter Strike and Valorant they don't have massive changes, they don't include things that can completely shift the gameplay from game to game, or even within the same game.

Potentially these changes will make it more fun as a casual experience.

What does everyone else think?
Am I being dramatic, or is this a concern."
Opinions on the introduction of perks?,Overwatch,64,1io0qwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1io0qwx/opinions_on_the_introduction_of_perks/,80,2025-02-12 21:23:49,"I'm not gonna lie I'm kinda of dreading perks in the game. One of my favourite things about overwatch is the fact that everyone is given the same kit for each hero and you have to get the best out of it with your skill. Perks to me needlessly complicate a game that is probably already overwhelming for new players.

In addition, the overwatch team has enough trouble balancing the cast as is; perks are likely going to make balancing so much worse. My prediction is the 'choice' they talk about each player having will disappear as soon as everyone works out which are the best or 'meta' perks for each hero.

I don't have the time or focus to go over all of my worries but I wanna know what other people's thoughts are. Am I just overthinking things? Is this just a preference thing? Please be civil, this is just my opinion based on nothing other than what was announced and my own feelings."

OWCS Tracker - Stage 2 Update,Competitiveoverwatch,56,1kjkhm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1kjkhm8/owcs_tracker_stage_2_update/,5,2025-05-10 23:12:11,"Surely this post doesn't get filtered & auto-deleted...

Hello friends, I've been continuing to work in the background on [Overwatch Tracker](https://ow-tracker.com/), a website that makes following OWCS easier. I wanted to share a bit of an update on the site and my plans.

https://preview.redd.it/9cgw8q1ur00f1.png?width=1853&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0315b94509068100f5d1070cfb0f9937368ef18

  
The site has been completely redesigned to focus around being a place to get all of the live match information, schedule, and statistics in one place.

On the site you can find info on matches like:

* The match time & status (ongoing / finished)
* Map picks
* Hero bans
* Replay codes
* Team rosters
* Players Twitch links (it'll also show if they're live!)
* Match statistics

I'd also like to announce that I'm working on Pick'ems! I am targeting Stage 2 Playoffs for people to be able to participate! Check out a little preview: [https://ow-tracker.com/pickems](https://ow-tracker.com/pickems)

https://preview.redd.it/3vc0ociks00f1.png?width=1742&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4871769120481febc8f19bf77a19a3902daf18d

  
Besides focusing on Pick'ems, I'm still working on getting data for Korea incorporated into the site (Japan, Pacific, and China too). It's a bit difficult compared to regions like NA / EMEA which are using FACEIT so I'm focusing on those regions for now. The stage 2 schedule is live but will not update just yet, working on getting it to automatically update.  
  
Please check out the site and lmk what you think! I'm really open to feedback of any kind and want to make the site the best it can be! The Discord is linked on the site.

Shuffling Sombra's power budget into mobility and uptime in fights - A Rework Concept,Competitiveoverwatch,4,1kfqrwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1kfqrwf/shuffling_sombras_power_budget_into_mobility_and/,15,2025-05-06 01:54:47,"Gonna go straight to the point/numbers and will add thoughts and theory at the end. No, this isn't a Support Sombra rework. Yes, I've played Sombra since OW1, and yes, I agree she's insufferable to play into for 90% of the playerbase.

Importantly, this rework DOES NOT NEED any new VFX, animations or voicelines, and requires minimal UI changes.

Edit: Formatting for clarity.

# REWORK BELOW

# BASE ATTRIBUTES

* Base movement speed increased by 10%.
* Now has 125 Shields.
* Regular Health reduced to 100 (Same total health, ie 225).

# WEAPON

**- Machine Pistol**

* 9 damage per bullet. Otherwise unchanged.

# ABILITIES

**- Hack (Secondary Fire)**  
Interrupts and disables the use of \*one\* of the target's abilities for 3 seconds. Hacked enemies are also revealed through walls for Sombra and her teammates.

* Cooldown: 9s
* Duration (lockout and wallhacks): 3s

Details:

* Ability targeted by Hack is always Ability 2 (E on PC).
* Can be used on deployables to disable them for 12 seconds. Can now target Symmetra's teleporter. Doing so makes it impossible for the deployable's owner to interact or redeploy the object for 4s (mostly affects LW).
* Can be used on healthpacks to make them exclusive for Sombra's team's use and regenerate faster for 45s. Doing so only imposes a 3s cooldown.
* Can be cleansed by Suzu and other self-cleansing abilities.
* Can be interrupted by LoS through terrain or shields. Doing so doesn't incur a cooldown penalty on Sombra.

NOTE: An argument could be made for Hack to disable Ability 1 (Shift) instead of Ability 2, but this targets most heroes' mobility and survivability tools, which DISPROPORTIONATELY affects almost every tank. Meanwhile, locking Ability 2 has more impact on fight-swinging Support cooldowns, but is less oppressive for a good portion of the cast. For this reason, I think Hack would be much less frustrating to much more people if it locks out Ability 2 instead. (Also, locking Ball out of Roll for 3s is OW1 all over again, but with A2 Doomfist still gets cucked out of Block :c He can still escape w Punch or Slam tho). A list of all heroes' A1 and A2 is at the bottom to provide comparison of impact between both options.

**- Stealth (Ability 1/Shift)**  
Become invisible for 3 seconds, gaining increased movement speed (70%) and slowly regenerating Sombra's shield HP (30 HPS).

* Cooldown: 12s
* Cast time: 0.25s

Details:

* \- If Sombra takes damage while invisible, she only becomes revealed for 1s.
* \- Sombra's footsteps are fully audible while invisible.
* \- Visual detection radius reduced to initial OW1's range (quite a bit shorter than now).
* \- Taking damage does not interrupt the healing effect, but being inflicted with anti-heal status effects does.
* \- Using Machine Pistol, Hack or EMP ends Stealth, but Translocator or reloading don't.

**- Translocator (Ability 2/E) (2 charges)**  
Lay down a teleportation beacon, which has a maximum active duration of 5s. When Sombra uses the ability again, she teleports to the beacon's location, gaining very brief invulnerability (0.4s) and also cleansing status effects.

* Beacon duration: 5s
* Cooldown: 8s per charge
* Charges: 2

Details:

* CANNOT be destroyed by enemy heroes.
* Translocator projectile speed is a middle point between old TP and current TP, but upon colliding with terrain, its momentum greatly reduces, falling to the ground almost vertically.
* Destroys railings and breakable objects upon collision.
* Can be destroyed by Sombra herself by pressing the Interact key.

**- EMP (Ultimate)**  
Hack all enemies and deployables in a wide area. Barriers are instantly destroyed.

Details:

* \- Being hacked by EMP interrupts and disables all abilities and ultimates for 3s.
* \- Damage component removed, mostly unchanged otherwise.

# PASSIVES

**- Opportunist**  
See low health enemies through walls. No more damage amp on hacked targets.

# PERKS

MINOR PERKS

**- Lights Off**  
Hack now interrupts and locks out all abilities for targeted hero for 0.5s on top of its regular effect.

**- Firewall**  
Upon using Translocator to return to the beacon, Sombra gains 30 Overhealth, which lasts for 5s. Overhealth gained from this perk cannot ever exceed 50.

MAJOR PERKS

**- White Hat**  
Hack can now be used on allies to shield and heal them. Grants allied target 50 Overhealth on use, which lasts for 1.5s, and restores target's HP by 60HPS for 4s (240 HP total). Hacking an ally cannot be interrupted by damage. EMP does not provide this effect to allies, and Hack's cooldown isn't reduced as it is in current version.

**- Back Door**  
Reset Stealth's cooldown upon elimination.

# THEORY AND CONCEPT

(TL;DR and can skip if uninterested)

Sombra needs a rebalancing of her power budget, and the recent controversies surrounding her ban rate and community perception betray that she needs it \*fast.\* If you're somehow out of the loop regarding this, I recommend watching [Questron's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nSUOL35X9M) on the issue, which was one of the biggest contributing factors to this rework idea.

**- PROBLEMS WITH OLDER ITERATIONS**

Each previous attempt at a rework has targeted different areas of Sombra's power, appeal and accessibility, both of playing her, with her, and against her. The first one in OW1 that made Stealth and TP infinite made her much easier to use, but her staying power in fights and overall uptime were severely affected.

The early OW2 rework took power out of Hack's CC and gave it to her gun, but it made Hack a clunky and spammy mess, which made Sombra extremely dependent on this ability to have impact, causing the enemy team to be \*constantly\* hacked over and over again. Meanwhile, the issues of her uptime and ease of engage/disengage were never addressed. After the release of Kiriko and the nerf of Hack's damage bonus, she was essentially a throw pick, but still a very irritating one to fight.

Then came the two Virus reworks. These made Sombra have less survivability, but with much higher burst damage, a somewhat cheesy kill combo that required much less skill to pull off than other flankers', and worse of all, the first one \*still\* didn't address how her kit encouraged low uptime problems.

The latest rework made her extremely inflexible in how she functions, and in exchange gave her even more burst damage, which greatly increases the frustration of fighting an enemy that pops out of nowhere and deletes you before you can react, thus compounding the already pre-existing frustrations of Sombra's soft-CC and escape options, and making playing support into her feel like Dead by Daylight for many players. And while her uptime issue was \*sort of\* addressed, her staying power in fights was neutered even more by lowering her HP and giving her no way to sustain herself during a brawl or dive. This makes Sombra an all-or-nothing hero, which imo has only increased the frustration of fighting her \*and\* playing her.

**- REWORK CONCEPTS AND REASONINGS**

This rework aims to address exactly that. With Translocator going back to being a uniquely designed escape tool, but limiting the time it remains active, this promotes Sombra to use it as a repositioning tool that she needs to carefully plan in order to use effectively. The limited duration also discourages simply leaving it on a health pack 50mts away from the fight, and promotes a more active use to cover multiple off-angles at once, using it to engage in a dive, or using it to return to the safety of your supports. The two charges are there to provide more flexibility for mind-games, and also an assurance that Sombra can stay in a fight or return to it briskly if she's pushed out, as well as giving her the ability to go for deeper flanks if needed. However, the longer cooldown on it means that if she's forced to use both charges back to back, she has a very long vulnerability period (of 8 to 16s!).

Another change that aims to shuffle Sombra's tools is the change to Stealth. Rather than being her engage tool, Stealth now is meant to be an escape and mid-fight sustain tool. Only 3s is not really enough to cross an entire battlefield, and the healing effect promotes Sombra to use it to reposition and reengage quickly mid-duel/fight rather than hide and be a rat for most of the match. Ofc, the much longer cooldown of 12s pushes it way more into this function, filling the same ability niche of Deflect or Recall, while also allowing Sombra to use it to cross short sightlines unnoticed if she needs to.

Finally, Hack locking out only one ability is meant to greatly reduce the overall frustration of the CC, but in return for this massive nerf, it also locks it out for a much longer time, and in turn, also has a much longer cooldown. Importantly, this makes it so Hack interacts more variably with the overall cast, with some heroes not even being affected by its base version (like Venture and perkless Bastion). It's also meant to only disable more offensive tank abilities rather than defensive ones, so that Hack can still hinder a tank's push without leaving them completely vulnerable as it does currently. The one exception is Doomfist :( Who gets cucked extra hard by this change, although he still retains the ability to use Slam or Punch to escape an interrupted Block.

However, the biggest aim of this Hack change is to counter important support and DPS cooldowns. Nade, Suzu, Orb, Lifegrip, Immortality, Res, Amp, Ice Wall and Discord are all disabled for a lengthy time, which can help an ally make an offensive play with less risk, while also allowing support players to still fight back against Sombra if she's using it to vs them personally. Ana can still sleep her, Kiriko, Moira, LW and Mercy can still run away, Brig can knock Sombra back, etc. Biggest winners of this change are Ball, Sigma and Rein, while the biggest losers are arguably the play-denying supports and specific DPS (landing a hack on Tracer denies Recall for 3s, for example, while Cassidy is unable to use Flashbang).

Through the Minor Perks, Hack regains the ability to cancel channeled ults and abilities, meant to allow Sombra the counterplay to particular heroes that she currently is known for, while still not being nearly as oppressive in the overall lockout timer. Remember, too, that Hack's cooldown is half as longer as current live. However, she gives up Firewall, which gives her a pretty hefty amount of mid-fight sustain and survivability that allows her to be much more aggressive, making the use of a universal interrupt Hack more of a greedy option.

Finally, White Hat is controversial among Sombra players, and I definitely think it needs more power to justify its existence. Making it a crazy save tool is adequate, imo, since it doesn't reduce the overall longer cooldown of this version of Hack. Since Hack is less universally useful as well, using it in this way gives Sombra a lot more versatility in how she chooses her perks if no one in the enemy team is particularly worth hacking due to their A2s.

This overall redistribution of power is capped by increasing Sombra's SMG damage. Without Virus to pad her DPS and poke, she \*needs\* more damage to function in her role. Currently, Virus + shooting without hack comes to a DPS of around 179 damage, with an initial burst of 35. Putting her gun damage squarely at 180 gives her similar DPS that is 100% reliant on her aim but with no burst, which is still decently high for a DPS. However, don't forget that Invisibility is a \*precious\* escape and self-sustain tool here, so no more pouncing from the shadows to delete you in one second. Additionally, no Virus means she can't endlessly poke from infinite range to drain resources and put pressure.

Overall, this concept is aimed at greatly increasing her mid-fight survivability, self-sustain, and mobility while also lowering the overall pain-points and frequency of her CC and invisibility, both of which get added options to make them more versatile and adaptive to whatever team comp Sombra is fighting.

And of course, needless to say, if any of these ideas were ever implemented, \*ALL SPECIFIC NUMBERS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE FOR BETTER BALANCE.\* This includes cooldowns, damage, and sustain values."
Lifeweaver Rework Idea,Competitiveoverwatch,0,1keipyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1keipyb/lifeweaver_rework_idea/,14,2025-05-04 14:31:52,"Despite general consensus being that Weaver has a poorly designed kit, I think Weaver has alot of potential if he was shifted to be more damage oriented

Health Decreased from 225 to 200

Thorn Volley: 

Damage increased from 6 > 7 per thorn

Projectile speed increased from 100 to 125 m/s

Spread reduced from 1.8 to 1.3

Superbloom is now a passive, after doing 80 damage to a target thorns explode dealing 30 damage instantly.

Damage dealt to players, shields or contructs  with Thorn Volley now charges Healing Blossom (Like Sojourn)

Healing Blossom:

Now has a minimum charge of 20
No longer requires switching weapons for use
No longer passively generates
Can now go through shields

Max heal increased from 80 to 100

When used at full charge, now heals a bonus 30 HP over 2 seconds for a total of 130 HP.

Life Grip: 

Holding the Lifegrip input will pull the targeted ally to lifeweaver, can be released any time along the path to end the pull.

Tapping the Lifegrip input will shield them for 0.75 seconds and heal them for 75 HP

Rejuvenating Dash: 
Triggers support passive on use
CD increased from 5 > 7 seconds
Now has 2 charges
No longer heals 45 HP.

Petal Platform:
Now breaks 2 seconds after initial use

Tree of Life: 
HP Decreased from 1200 to 1000
AoE increased from 12m to 14m 
No longer provides overhealth
Allies in Range gain 30% Damage Reduction

I need to think on a perk to replace Superbloom idk yet.

Does anyone play on Linux?

One thing stopping me years ago has been the poor state of gaming on Linux. Steam seems to be investing into making the Steam Deck great with Proton to run games like Overwatch 2. This video got me semi interested: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUrxcfzEKgs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUrxcfzEKgs)

You would think that not natively running the game has weird issues due to the on the fly conversion via Proton/Wine but most stuff I read has people stating that Linux has a potential to actually have a smoother experience than Windows on games due to all the overhead Windows has that Linux does not. Maybe it's still bad but wanted to ask."
Rumors so far,Competitiveoverwatch,53,1kdljrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1kdljrf/rumors_so_far/,15,2025-05-03 07:29:14,"With roster lock in sight, how many rumors do we have here and how likely are they? These are for people who might not be as terminally online as me. Reminder that these are just rumors and not set in stone and can easily change.

Viol2t-Since Viol2t is participating in faceit on vision esports, it means that he will not be able to join an owcs team for stage 2. The rumor is that he left for personal reasons/to dodge military service and once he was lft Vision outbid everyone and offered a larger amount of salary than even Zeta division previously.

TM-Twisted Minds hasn't officially released Irony but he is almost certainly off the roster. Cointree has mentioned on CXs stream that this is mainly due to the large language barrier above all else. The rumor is that they are going to get Simple as their flex support, but I don't know how credible this is. As for did they try to bid for Viol2t, from what I've heard they already had someone else by the time Viol2t was lft. There is also a rumor that Sirmajed is going to TM, but I don't think this one is super likely.

TU-Heesung is already semi confirmed on TU both on uncoachable with Unter saying that Chris got a korean main tank and Chris himself on CXs stream chat. This means that Faith is likely the one getting released and Twilight likely staying. As for who they are getting on main support, I have no clue.

NTMR-With Zeruhh not appearing on faceit with the ex-NTMR players and instead Wmaimone appearing there, it is likely that he was picked up by presumably Liquid. Knife is still in NA so I don't know what is going on. Rumor says that Envy also might've picked up the rest of the NTMR players, but still very muddy.

S9mm-The rumor says that he will be making a return to Pro Overwatch by joining Supernova for NA owcs as Chime has shifted most of his focus to Marvel Rivals. Very likely to happen.

Frost Tails-Frost Tails are a team that clenched top 8 for owcs through relegation, but their tank player Kroxz and support Egs who was rumored to be joining appeared on faceit along with NA player K1ng and Sakura player Zorrow. I don't know what will happen here.

Someone and Mer1t-It is likely that Someone atleast is going to Falcons same with Mer1t. But there were rumors that they were both in talks with T1 for not just stage 1, but also this stage.

Old Ocean- Becky said on discord that he will join once he's back to Korea from SEL.

Punk-Rumor says that he's back for ewc taking MFC roster slot.

Hitori-Rumored to be joining Avidity in NA as an import

That's about all the rumors that I have got. I don't know any players coaches or anyone else in the know, I just like ow esports and has too much free time on their hands. If anything is wrong or if there are any rumors I might've missed please just comment the and I'll edit the post."

ive seen all the discourse over the past few months about basically just how bad mercy and LW are, and so my question is in metal ranks if that even matters? i feel like ive learned a lot about playing mercy and LW, i know to dmg boost dps and prioritize res on tanks and staying alive, on LW its giving and accessing high ground easily, consistent heals and decent poke dmg on tanks, and saving teammates with grip without sacrificing map control etc.

  
recently ive had a few games where i just want to play either of those 2 heroes and before the game even starts teammates will either ban my pick or assume we will lose because those heroes ""dont provide value"". and that thought was really shocking to me because any video i see by high elo players talking about the meta or talking about lower elo players is that the heroes you choose dont really matter. and that in metal ranks pretty much its anything goes as long as ur able to stay alive and do ur job by healing/pressure/making space, its fine. 



at least thats what i thought, but people seem to think it matters solely on the hero youre playing. i actually felt so bad seeing all the hate mercy was getting and although shes my main it made me not play her anymore for fear i would get called out in chat and have people flaming me for no reason. if i want to be mercy but we're running winston torb tracer im not gonna stay mercy, if i keep dying and am not able to dmg boost then ill swap, its frustrating having people assume im shit at the game for the hero i choose. of course not everything will work all the time no matter the elo but am i wrong for being in gold/low plat wanting to play 'off meta"" heroes? is it really that bad to play them in this rank? 

  
i just dont get the 'play a real support' comments. yeah there are bad mercys that healbot tank, yeah theres bad LW's that pull you out of ult or whatever, but we're also in the same rank? mistakes happen on every role and that's how we learn and get better. and i do want to get better but cant i be good at LW? cant i be a good mercy? i mean as good as you can get in gold but still. it feels weird. maybe a bit unrelated but just saw a youtube video of a guy target banning his teams ashe pick only because they were an ashe main. and the streamer is just there laughing and giggling at him being upset that they banned ashe, that really rubbed me the wrong way. anyways, ive learned now just to not pick a preferred hero cause people will just be weird. 

  
wondering what high elo players think about this and if theres some lower elo too id love to hear your experiences and thoughts too"

Why add third person mode? Have you found it to be a significant change in balancing and playing?

> blizz_Dylan

We’ve talked about this a bit in interviews, but Overwatch has always had third-person elements as part of its gameplay since it first launched! Abilities like Reinhardt or Brigitte’s shield, Junkrat’s tire, etc.; where it made sense and players would benefit from the additional environmental context, we used it.   
  
As so much of Stadium focused on expanding and pushing hero fantasy, often by making hero abilities more explosive or impactful, we found that having a third-person option on **all** of the time was the best method to give players that extra peripheral information to cover these new sources of visual noise.   
  
I actually have found that a full third-person mode **hasn’t** impacted our balancing philosophy too much, though there are of course growing pains associated with any move like this. That said, I personally enjoy using 3p almost exclusively, as I find it really helps sell the feel we’re going for with Stadium.

-------------------------------------


> Madrizzle1

How does the mostly positive feedback feel after working so hard to claw back fan trust?

> blizz_Dylan

I can only speak for myself, but every step of our launch of Stadium, from the reveal during Spotlight until now, has been absolutely incredible and surreal. In game development (and indeed in most professional pursuits, I think), it can be very easy to be so close to something, you lose sight of just how special or enjoyable your work is. You can see every blemish or shortcoming or bit you still want to perfect, but all the wonderful progress often gets harder and harder to see.   
  
So seeing folks respond so positively to Stadium, Season 16, and even Season 15 before this has been extremely energizing and an important reminder that hey, most importantly, the team made something **fun**. We’re beyond thrilled to have hit a point where we now get to collaborate with all of you to grow Stadium into something even greater.

> Falcon_Kick

Similarly to Dylan I can only speak for myself too, but I started at Blizzard on the Overwatch League in 2017, so you can imagine all of the ups and downs we've been through in 8 years since then. Blizzard has been around for decades at this point, Overwatch has been around for nearly 10 years itself, there are literally generations of people who work here these days. I am of a younger generation, some on the Stadium team are of an older generation, others are the next generation after me. It is extremely validating and cathartic that, after so many years and with so much change in Blizzard, in Overwatch, we can still put out something new and exciting that is (hopefully) true to what our fans want right now, in 2025. We are all so happy yall are enjoying it.

> kuryniyson

Hello! I have some questions about stadium:  
  
1. Is there any plan to introduce the stadium into custom games in the near future, perhaps mid-season or in the next season?

2. Are there any plans to add consumable items, such as healing kits or temporary buffs for characters, similar to features seen in other comparable projects? Additionally, would you consider implementing items designed to counter specific characters? I believe this could make build diversity more interesting and help players survive better against certain matchups

> blizz_Dylan

We will have more to share soon, but the short answer is we absolutely want to get custom games for Stadium up and running.   
  
In regard to counter-specific items, we have some in the game already as being able to “counter-build” is a key part of Stadium’s identity. For example, both Ashe and Junker Queen have items to help give them some sort of value out of having their Wound or Burn effects cleansed, because those are core aspects of their kit identity. Similarly, D.VA and Genji were given options to help them tackle beam attacks, where they normally would not be able to directly interact with that matchup. We’ll continue keeping an eye out for severe cases like those, and items or Powers that address them are absolutely on the table!

-------------------------------------


> LoudMouth73

If I remember correctly on the roadmap for the year under season 16 there was a map on the stadium part of the season which I think was either Kings Row or Midtown, so I ask is there any plans to have the payload modes in clash or is that something that just can’t really happen?

> blizz_Dylan

As you may have noticed in Stadium, we have a mix of new and old maps that we felt fit the pace and mechanics we wanted to highlight in Stadium. In one of those cases, we have a Paris map which, while it may have some thematic similarities to a classic Overwatch map, is by and large made with brand new art and designed from scratch to fit the game mode it features (Push).    
  
We found that this was a great opportunity to take a fresh approach to locations from Overwatch’s history, and I would say don’t be surprised if you see us do more of that in the future ;)

-------------------------------------


> Algernon_Frost

Thanks for taking the time to do an AMA and working on this new mode.

What are somethings you would like to share with the community that you normally would not be able to?

Bonus: would you rather fight 1 horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses?

> blizz_Dylan

Normally they would forbid me from saying this, but now that my chains are broken and my personality truly unleashed, I would like to share with the community that I think they’re super neat and I want them to have a great day.   
  
Bonus: 100 duck-sized horses are just begging to be punted and I will not elaborate any further.

-------------------------------------


> Blizz_Megan

So I see we have a Paris map and that just leads the ask, HORIZON LUNAR COLONY MAP WHEN GUYS

> blizz_Dylan

Winston: “Winston? Winston!”  
Hammond: “*squeak, squeaksqueak squeaaaaak!”*  
Robot Voice: “The hamster demands to know the answer as well.”

-------------------------------------


> novelgpa 

I love all the item/power names - what's the process like for coming up with them? Do you all just bounce names off each other until 1 sticks? Is it challenging to translate them to different languages?

> blizz_Dylan

Really glad you like them! The names have changed a **lot** over the development of the mode. Early on, many of them were very literal; if an Power gave Juno another charge of Pulsar Torpedoes, it was probably at one point called “More Torpedoes” or something along those lines. This also made it easier to adapt our various documentation when we would change or swap different Powers/Items and their effects (don’t ask Sadie how many times she was forced to redo icons because of this, she’ll throw things at me).   
  
In the most recent pass, which is what we ended up shipping with, I kept a fair number of the clever names our team had come up with over time (there were lots of fun brainstorms over the years!), and then attempted to introduce a good balance of humor, informative practicality, and a sprinkling of fun lore nods where I could. Conor also requested that we try to keep things like Items feeling suitably “physical,” like they’re literal **items** that you could hold. Powers could be a bit more nebulous, a bit more conceptual, less literal.   
  
As far as translation goes, we are super fortunate to have an incredible team of localization pros at Blizzard that work on all of our titles, and they continue to crush it even as we hand them awful (amazing) puns. Yes, I came up with “Two-zu.” No, I will not apologize.

-------------------------------------


> Miennai

Who are your favorite heroes to play in Stadium? Favorite builds on those heroes?

> blizz_SadBoy

Personally, I love playing Ana! I favor builds that increase her weapon power and allow her to fight on her own terms. A ‘lone wolf’ type of Ana, which I feel suits her very well :)

> falcon_kick

I’m someone who loves experimenting so I intentionally try to go for builds that aren’t popular. One really fun one I like to try is weapon power Juno, with the Stinger power to start. Stinger lets you get some really interesting early econ boost because you’re involved in almost every kill!

> Blizz_Keville

I'm a little biased because I implemented these, but I really enjoy taking Fleet Foot and Clone Conjuration on Kiriko and living out that ninja fantasy, going for flank kills and assassinations.

> blizz_toby

One hero in the main game that never clicked with me was Mei and once I tried the rolling ice block build on her in a playtest I was sold.

> Blizz_ConorKouzy

Hybrid/Ability Power Genji is just too fun! But Melee Genji also gives it a run for its money.

I’ve also been known to terrorize some of our internal playtests on Charge Reinhardt. Rumor has that the Charge build works 30% better if you’ve got the Conductor skin equipped…

-------------------------------------


> slimshinoda

Why there is new abilities like mei's snowball while others like Cassidy don't have anything new, only options to get better damage or cooldowns?

I really believe one big part of the fun is the new abilities instead of just overpowering current abilities

> blizz_SadBoy

That’s a great question and maybe something to keep in mind for the future, though I keep suggesting that Cassidy should turn into a giant tumbleweed and mosey around, but Dylan said no :(

> Blizz_Larrypickle

To provide some design insight on this - one rough guideline we try to do is to have a couple flashy / transformative powers per hero. We don’t always hit the mark on these though and sometimes during the iteration process we have to remove them due to gameplay issues, so certain heroes have less. They are the most expensive to develop from an art standpoint and require the most design iteration as well, so no promises for now, but we will be continuing to iterate on all heroes’ existing powers / items.

-------------------------------------


> RexLongbone

What hero was the most challenging to design powers for?

> blizz_SadBoy

Sadie - On the art and UI side of things, there’s a few heroes that come to mind. Our tankier heroes who have larger silhouettes need more space vs. our DPS/Support heroes. My personal dem(ei)on was Mei - a lot of her abilities affect others, so having to illustrate and convey ice was a challenge! There also is a hero coming up in a future season that led to some explosive hurdles to jump….

-------------------------------------


> JeffTek

Thanks for the AMA! Been an Overwatch enjoyer since launch, and I am in love with Stadium, yall are doing great.

My question: Generally speaking, would you say the Stadium dev team is more like a plate of lobster ravioli or a plate of miniature finger sandwiches made with Pimento cheese?

> blizz_SadBoy

*I think this is the hardest question to answer from this AMA….I can’t speak for every other person on the team, but some days you feel like a lobster ravioli and other days you feel like a left out plate of miniature finger sandos, you know?*

-------------------------------------


> LightScavenger

Loving the mode so far! My question is as follows: when designing heroes for the mode, do you generally prefer transformative powers that change hero fantasy, or abilities that double down on existing hero strengths?

> blizz_SadBoy

This is a really fantastic question, thank you for asking! While we do like to keep within each hero's respective hero fantasy and design, we also don’t want to limit ourselves in any way. Overall, it’s dependent on each hero and their lore/background. For example, our beloved ‘Flying Rein’ feels like something he’d absolutely do - maybe he bugged Brigitte to enhance his suit or something. But his character personality is exuberant, over the top. Whereas Reaper (who also has a flying ability) seems much more covert due to his wraith form. And that ideology applies to our other heroes too - Ana, for example, would look horribly out of place soaring through the air (though as an Ana main I think that would be pretty sick).

-------------------------------------


> RobManfredsFixer

What successes and issues have you found with how the ranking system works? Any solutions you're considering to improve the player experience? (Matchmaking adjustments, surrender option, etc)

Knowing it's not the same as regular ranked, I think part of it is that players need to temper their expectations, but there are also some legitimate complaints as well.

> Blizz_Shedrick

I think the biggest success we've seen with the ranked system so far is how accessible it is. We really wanted the funnel to be open as wide as possible to give everyone a chance to jump in and have fun right away!

For matchmaking in particular, we're always looking for ways to improve on the experience. Because Stadium is a brand new mode, the matchmaker hasn't had much of an opportunity to put players where they need to be yet. That being said, things will absolutely smooth out over time as people play more matches and settle into their ranks.

-------------------------------------


> jookum

Awesome mode! Loved it since the first playtest and basically haven't put it down.

Brawl seems to be the clear and obvious best way to play the game. Do you think there are ways to evolve the game past just ramming your head at the other team, or is it just a function of the current roster (reaper, rein, etc)?

Also, are there plans for a toggle 1p/3p button? Navigating to settings isn't the worst but I wonder if a simple toggle keybind is possible

> Blizz_Shedrick

Great question!

I think this largely comes down to which heroes you and your teammates pick. Brawl can absolutely be a viable play style, but it tends to leave you vulnerable to counter-play from heroes that have a strong flank game. Ashe is a great example here: if you're going up against a Rein that is building into shield health, you're gonna have a really bad time staying in the back line and pouring ammo into a shield that will basically never break. Instead, taking an angle to try to pressure their supports can be a great way to either get picks or at least force their Rein to fall back to help (I know, I know; we can all dream).

As for a 1p/3p toggle, this is not something that we're currently planning on doing, but that doesn’t mean it’s entirely out of the question. We're always looking for feedback from the community on what they want to see next and there's nothing stopping us from revisiting a feature if it garners enough interest!

-------------------------------------


> Lubok

Stadium matchmaking questions.

- Is there an internal MMR that is not bound to visual rank?
- If so was it seeded from other modes (perhaps with a soft reset) or is it full blank slate?
- Will it be soft/hard reset for every season in Stadium?
- Is matchmaking currently more similar to QP in terms of allowed MMR ranges in a match (even without cosidering lack of grouping restrictions)?

I see some amount of speculations and questions about that so would be cool to have something to refer to. Thanks!

> Blizz_Shedrick

Q. Is there an internal MMR that is not bound to visual rank?  
A. Yes, we use an internal MMR for matchmaking that is independent of a player's visual rank. However, we apply various bonuses, such as calibration and win streak bonuses, to help better align a player's visual rank with their internal MMR.  
  
Q. If so, was it seeded from other modes (perhaps with a soft reset), or is it a full blank slate?  
A. The internal MMR is a full blank slate, with logic similar to that of competitive matches.  
  
Q. Will it be a soft or hard reset for every season in Stadium?  
A. Currently, we plan to perform a soft reset of MMR at the start of each Stadium season.  
  
Q. Is matchmaking currently more similar to Quick Play in terms of allowed MMR ranges in a match (even without considering the lack of grouping restrictions)?  
A. Stadium matchmaking is more similar to competitive matchmaking than to Quick Play.

-------------------------------------


> sinciety

Hi big fan of stadium so far. My one main issue with the mode is sometimes it feels like the team match ups can be a little oppressive i.e. dva into zarya (although the beam defense buff did help) or mei reaper in rein.

Is there any possibilities of a draft mode to help avoid hard counter compositions?

> blizz_duffin

Hero bans are still a new system in Overwatch, and we felt it would be too limiting with Stadium’s current roster. We may revisit Hero bans for Stadium in the future, when the cast is much larger.

-------------------------------------


> The_frost__ 

Is there a reason why third person is over the shoulder instead of center behind the characters like Rein?

> blizz_duffin

If characters are too centered it can block the reticle during certain abilities. We’re always working on improvements to the camera per hero, and a centered camera fit better for Reinhardt’s kit.


-------------------------------------


> Frostlark

I believe Stadium to be inherently snowbally given the nature of the currency and build system. Is this by design and is there any way to remedy this in the works? It personally limits my enjoyment, though I suppose I don't have any data to show this is true



> blizz_duffin

Asymmetrical power was always a part of the design. The bounty system and boost system were both implemented to keep matches from being too snowbally. We’re reviewing feedback and in-game stats on how it is all working to see about any future adjustments. Nothing to share at the moment.

-------------------------------------


> Icedmanta

Hi! First off, I’d like to say just how much my friends and I have been enjoying this mode - it goes beyond just a simple mode, and feels like a whole new game.

How different has the development pipeline been from the standard base game dev team? Have there been any unique challenges or considerations that people might not expect? It seems like there are so many more moving parts compared to the regular game, and I’m wondering what it looks like on the other side of the glass.

> blizz_duffin

Glad you’re all enjoying it! Thanks for sharing, to your question:

While game development is always collaborative, giant new features like Stadium are more of a group effort than normal. Different teams have unique specializations and contribute to stadium on top of their regular work. While there are devs dedicated to stadium (like Dylan), a large part of the team is still supporting the live game WHILE working on stadium. An example would be some of the level designers are working on maps for both modes, or artists splitting time depending on what has the need at that moment.

While there were many unexpected challenges, one example of a challenge that gained complexity was the scoreboard. It required performance optimization, controller navigation, social feature interaction, lots of UI work and tooltips. Many different engineers, designers, artists, and analysts on different teams contributed to the success of that one feature. Unlike some other flashier features when the scoreboard is working well, nobody notices it

-------------------------------------


> RobManfredsFixer

How will you prioritize which heroes will be added?

What kind of factors affect this? Difficulty adapting them to the format? Popularity of a given hero? Considering you can't change heroes, have you considered prioritizing popular ""one trick"" heroes?

> blizz_duffin

The current plan is to add new heroes to stadium the mid season after they release. For existing heroes, there are many factors that determine which heroes enter the stadium. While hero popularity is one, gameplay is generally considered first. Kind of like how DVA was introduced into Overwatch at the same time Mei was. Its important to maintain healthy game balance when introducing new choices. We hope to get everyone eventually, but the live game isn't always the best measurement of who should be next, because stadium's gameplay balance is very different from other live modes.

-------------------------------------


> martinMayhem

How do you feel about the fact that modern gaming communities often focus heavily on min/maxing? With the influence of content creators, forums, and other resources, it's now incredibly easy to access 'broken' builds, rather than players experimenting and figuring things out for themselves. Because stadium is currently competitive only, there's a strong incentive to follow the path of least resistance, which indirectly forces players to go with the flow and look up optimized builds, rather than encouraging them to create weird, goofy, and less optimal ones.

> falcon_kick

I’m glad you asked this question, as I have some background on both sides of this. Before I joined Blizzard I created these sorts of resources for the community, and then after joining I have been creating the internal tools we use to stay ahead of this exact behavior. As you’ve mentioned, players have incredible resources to improve in all aspects of our games, and that’s without us really sharing much data at all! In regular Overwatch as well, these sorts of pressures to ‘play optimally’ exist.

Our strategy (generally) has been to keep the game fresh with regular changes to combat this pressure and also fight against a feeling of staleness of play. Even the most beloved “metas” in the past grew repetitive over time and we owed it to our players to shake the game up on a regular basis. I believe there is a sweet spot of adjusting hero balance often enough that the game doesn’t get stale, but letting things stew long enough for players to master a given state of the game.

Ultimately, most of the “optimal” builds, comps, or playstyles start off as “goofy” at one point or another, and that part in a meta’s lifecycle is very important. That being said, it’s also very fun to play OP stuff! But just not for too long. It’s a tricky line to walk. It's up to us to keep things new, fresh, and changing often enough that that cycle of discovery and mastery is a constant in our game. We’re doing the best that we can and learning with every patch.

I will say though, our internal tools do indicate that there is … if not a goofy hero+build, certainly a less-popular hero that is winning quite handily that few players are playing relatively: Lucio!

-------------------------------------


> swarlesbarkley_

Can we expect any “inspiration” to be taken from stadium items/powers and be used in future updates to perks in the main mode? Or vice versa?

PS stadium is awesome!! Thanks for all that you do :)

> falcon_kick

I may have pitched a stadium power as a major perk for a particular hero because I liked it so much, and a version of it may be coming in the future, but I’m not sure I can say which one :)

-------------------------------------


> Owl_Lover_Livvy

How does the balancing process for Stadium look compared to the rest of the game? I imagine it's a lot more complicated given that each character is basically 3 in 1.

> falcon_kick

Hoo boy this is the big question isn’t it! Stadium adds many more layers of complexity to Overwatch than the base game has. Economy, bounties, powers, items, a different ranked system, tons and tons of depth of play.

In terms of just raw dashboard count, I think we have 3-4x as many ways to look at balance for Stadium than for baseline Competitive. As a non-exhaustive list of what we’re considering, we’ve got

- Power win and pick rates
- Item win and pick rates
- Hero win and pick rates
- Item pick rates globally (not considering hero)
- Economy data (where are players earning currency? What are they spending it on?)
- Match outcome data (how long are matches? How often do comebacks occur? What is the relationship between economy and outcomes?)
- And many, many more

The trickiest problem of them all is what to do with >combinations< of powers and items, or Builds, because there are an incredible amount of combinations available in Stadium, but only a few of them might be ""required"" to comprise what we as players would define as a Build. This is a unique problem to Stadium that the base game simply does not have. At best, we can make an educated guess about what a build might be, before trying to roll up millions of matches worth of data to analyze its performance. But that approach is far too manual, dependent on individual subjectivity, and doesn’t scale when we need to rapidly make changes to Stadium to address balance concerns. We needed a way to automate asking the right question (what builds exist for this hero?) before performing analyses (is this build performing well?). 

We do so by pre-treating the data with cluster analyses on the heroes and their power+item combinations, which label the players and matches with labels like “Build 1” or “Build 2”, such that they can be categorized, defined, and aggregated later. We then use various methods (power occurrence, item occurrence, ability keyword occurrence) to describe the builds so that we can say things like “Junker Queen Build 1 is a Carnage+Rampage build that tends to use the Thirsty for Blood item”, and be able to say that Junker Queen Build 1 has whatever Win Rate or Usage Rate. This gives us deeper insight into whether an individual power or item is overpowered, or if the combination of several powers and items, not individual, is what could be targets for nerfs or buffs.

> VisionaireX

This is an amazingly well thought out and transparent answer. Thank you

> Falcon_Kick

anytime \^_^

-------------------------------------


> deafhaven

Which heroes are most popular right now in Stadium?

> falcon_kick

**Damage:** Soldier 76 is far out ahead of the rest, however the rest of the cast are fairly close together

**Support:** Juno is most-picked, the rest are within 15% of her pick rate except for Lucio who is last by a fair margin (he’s very good though!)

**Tank:** Similarly to Soldier, Reinhardt is a decent way ahead of the rest of the tanks, but the rest of the tanks are very closely grouped in pick rate.

-------------------------------------


> cyber_davi7

How lose?

> falcon_kick

I winn’t

-------------------------------------


> A55MA5TER69 

Do you have data that tracks which items and powers are the most popular/have the highest winrate for every hero? Whether you do or not, do you still plan to buff or nerf the powers that feel like outliers?

> falcon_kick

Short answer: Yes

Longer answer: This sort of balancing (tracking outliers on the high and low end) is how we approach all of our design, I wrote a little more information on that process in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1ka3ap9/we_are_the_overwatch_stadium_team_ask_us_anything/mpjtb5m/)

> Blizz_Larrypickle

To add onto Ben’s answer, data plays a big part in what we decide to buff / nerf and we will be active in adjusting power outliers. However, player perception also plays a large part in what we decide to adjust, and if something feels particularly difficult to counterplay or frustrating to play against, we may adjust that sooner even if the data suggests it’s not an outlier. The two usually do support each other but not always.


-------------------------------------



> IAmBLD

What's the process for coming up with items and builds for a new hero like? Were there maybe scrapped ideas for Freja during development that became powers later? Do you plan for future new heroes to be fast-tracked into Stadium?

> Blizz_LarryPickle

Thanks for the question! We usually start with a set of archetypes that hit on different fantasies or focus on a different part of the hero’s kit. Usually we want one ‘core fantasy +’ build that typically empowers the core gameplay loop of that hero, and then the other archetypes typically introduce new gameplay patterns or more transformative effects. After we have a set of archetypes, we usually want 2-3 core powers to support each of those archetypes, and then the rest are filled out with more flexible powers that are applicable to a number of archetypes.

We did turn an early prototype for Freja’s ultimate into a power.

I believe the current thinking is to prioritize getting new heroes into Stadium the midseason after they’re released.


> falcon_kick

I’m not a designer but Larry has to deal with me invading his dms with all sorts of crackpot ideas. I’m awesome at terrible ideas, so they just do the opposite of what I pitch.

> beigemore

At the end of a match, will it ever be possible to show the ""best"" POTG from the entire match rather than just the POTG from the last round?

A play of play of the game the game…intriguing…

-------------------------------------


> LinkRTX 

Wanted to know if there was any problems with animation while working on 3rd person view, you say there was a lot of work, hope to know if something funny was happening while doing all this :)

And thank you for your amazing dedication and passion for Overwatch, you are leading the game in the best direction it ever could've taken!

> blizz_BruceW

Something interesting here is we had to expand our current animation system to be able to deal with uniquely tuned VFX for the new 3rd person camera.  Sometimes an effect can look great in 1P due to the camera perspective, but when viewing that same VFX in 3P it starts to not read correctly.  Our VFX team did a great job finding and dealing with a bunch of these!

-------------------------------------


>  Shaclo

Is there any plans to add ways to generate money from mitigating damage. On tank it feels really incentivised to play aggressive and not as supportive with shielding upgrades as you often end up behind the enemy tank which leads to unfun/ one sided games.

> Blizz_ConorKouzy

We do not have any plans to grant Stadium Cash from mitigating damage. Currently our Stadium Cash generation from damage and healing matches closely to how Ultimate Charge or Perk experience gain works. Part of the reason for this is that some heroes can mitigate infinite amounts of damage (looking at you D.Va…). Mitigating damage also prevents your opponents from generating Stadium Cash, just like it does to Ultimate Charge so there is some important currency impact that occurs from damage mitigation.

We’ve attempted to give every hero a tankier/utility focused build path that players can pivot into when they’re falling behind. This is paired with our Survival items generally being lower in price as intended to allow you to still be effective for your team even when you’re not having your best game. And this isn’t just isolated to Tanks. I’m sure you’ve encountered a few tanky Reapers and Soldier76s out there.

> Falcon_Kick

To add to Conor’s post, we do track >where< players are earning currency generally from various sources, and are keeping track of the rate of currency gain across various heroes and roles.

> Blizz_Keville

I feel you on this one. It was one of my first bits of feedback after we added damage and healing based currency that we should consider adding mitigation currency for this exact reason. We even playtested with it for a while. Another reason behind the decision in addition to the ones Conor mentioned was that it just sort of felt bad to know that any time you broke Rein's shield you just gave him a ton of money. It was almost like an infinite duration Zarya bubble, where they kept the power in between rounds.

It seems like there are so many more moving parts compared to the regular game, and I’m wondering what it looks like on the other side of the glass.

> Blizz_Keville

First off, so happy to hear how much fun you and your friends are having! This is amazing to hear.

One thing people might not expect, is just how many different iterations Stadium went through on its journey to launch. You can see a little bit of this by comparing Stadium to Junkenstein's Lab, whose random nature more closely resembled what we were considering shipping Stadium with at the time. When making something that you want to feel like a whole new experience, there really isn't any better way than to try something new, play it yourself, see if it's fun, and keep trying until it is. Which can take a long time! After many attempts at this, we're so excited about how Stadium turned out and the reception it's getting from players like yourself :)

-------------------------------------

Since Stadium does not have swapping, how does the team think about design with adding heroes like Pharah or Ball, who in regular play often demand swapping in order to effectively interact with them? 

Loving Stadium so far. Keep up the great work! 

> Blizz_ConorKouzy

In Stadium we are always striving for players to feel like they have the tools to pick from to adapt to their opponents. We have tried to create Hero Items that help soften some of the worst matchups. We also try to create answers in the general items. For example, if you’re struggling with beam heroes we’ve got a lot of ways to get Armor to reduce a significant amount of that damage. Additionally we also try to create builds and powers that are stronger in certain hero matchups. Ultimately we’re trying to create an experience where you feel like you can play the hero you chose in any matchup, even if you’re at a slight disadvantage. We know we’ve not perfectly hit that mark just yet. We will continue to try to add the answers every hero needs.

As we continue to add more heroes to Stadium, we will also update previous heroes to make sure they have the tools needed to combat the newly added heroes.

> Blizz_Keville

Expanding on Conor’s answer, one of the core goals of Stadium's design is that we empower you to replace counter swapping with counter building. An example of the kind of upgrade we've made for this is Genji's Anti-Beam Coating, which you can buy in those Zarya/Mei/Moira games that ordinarily make you feel like you have to swap off. To your point though, we do have our design work cut out for us with Pharah and Ball, which is part of why we decided not to include them in the launch roster. Can't speak to any specifics yet but we're certainly talking about ways we can address these matchups too and make them fun.

-------------------------------------


> TechnicalAd2963 

Loving Stadium! Have you guys explored customized presaved load outs? Similar to the prebuilds the heroes already have, my friends and I like to use the same powers and would think it would be a nice quality of life to have 1 predesigned build ready to go that we can make ourselves so we don’t have to always navigate the armory :)

> Blizz_Keville

I can't promise anything right now, but I'll just say that we definitely hear you on wanting custom builds, and it's something we're very interested in too.

> suckmesideways111

huge fan of stadium. it's a lot of what i have wanted from ow for a very long time. thank you for swinging big on this. really excited to see where it goes from here.

what do you feel is the biggest win you got as a team in getting this mode released? conversely, are there any features or specific heroes you had hoped to include in the initial release that just missed the deadline?

bonus question if youre able: any thoughts being kicked around about adding a set of active items (short cc/interrupts with cast time, short dashes, etc) to help counter-play out a bit more?

> Blizz_Keville

Honestly, at the risk of sounding corny, comments like yours that reaffirm that this feels like a big swing and something you all are really enjoying, feel like the biggest win to me. I'm also just happy to have been part of creating something that I genuinely don't want to stop playing, and see that other people feel the same way. 

Regarding active items, as a MOBA player, I love this idea. One of the unique challenges for us compared to most MOBAs though is that we're on console, and controllers have a limited number of ""keybinds"" available. That is one of the reasons we tend to prefer adding additional effects to existing abilities. For example, instead of an unstoppable active item, we have Reinhardt's Crusader's Cure, which cleanses while charging. In general though, upgrades that give you more active counterplay is definitely an interest of ours.

> Blizz_ConorKouzy

The team is so excited about Stadium as a new way to experience Overwatch. Seeing the heroes we’ve had for years reimagined with new power progression has brought so much fun and joy to the Overwatch team.

Bonus Question:
We have dabbled in adding extra dashes and inputs. For example, Ana is able to get a little jump dash. That said, we’ve avoided it in general because we don’t want to add too many extra inputs to the game. But there is still some room for us to explore here.

-------------------------------------


> ModWilliam

Will new heroes always be added to Stadium quickly, the way Freja will be?

> Blizz_Larrypickle

The current plan is to add new heroes the midseason after they release!

-------------------------------------


> Miennai

Someone revealed during a Dev interview that Freya will be the next hero added to stadium, sometime in the mid-season. Can we get a sneak peek of some of Freya's powers?

> Blizz_Larrypickle

There will be a power that lets Freja shoot a powered down version of her ultimate much more frequently.

-------------------------------------


> TangeloLongjumping96

Will heroes who are already released ever get new unique items?

> Blizz_Larrypickle

We will continue to iterate on existing heroes based on the developing meta and data. Depending on the issue we want to solve (e.g. a build is unviable or has gameplay issues), it’s totally possible that the best solution is to add or rework existing hero items / powers.

How long have you been playing OW now?,Competitiveoverwatch,93,1k9qejo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1k9qejo/how_long_have_you_been_playing_ow_now/,121,2025-04-28 10:14:58,"We're not that far from the 10-year anniversary (Overwatch Beta was in October 27, 2015), and it got me thinking about how I first started playing Overwatch. Back then, I had no idea about all the hype. I missed the beta entirely. I just saw the game at a store, liked the design, and decided to buy it on a whim.

I remember playing for the first 2–3 days and even posting on a forum about how bad I thought the game was, cause it had no real story, the queue times were too long for me, and there was way too much downtime running from spawn to the action. But I still really liked the design.

Now, 9 years later, I've put in over 2000 hours, played in tournaments, Open Division, and even been part of a professional team, and I still play the game more or less daily.
I also remember how hyped I was for the first World Cup, how I bought a pizza, something to drink, and set up a hookah to smoke while watching the first OWL matches. Still miss the OWL. It was pretty hype, tbh.

Were you able to play the beta and experience things like shield Bastion or dash-bleed Genji? How long have you been playing OW?"
Freja is a great example of why Perks are the future of Overwatch,Competitiveoverwatch,117,1k8tuyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1k8tuyv/freja_is_a_great_example_of_why_perks_are_the/,25,2025-04-27 04:42:48,She's such a good example of how new Heroes can be made to realize their potential without needing to making them too powerful with their abilities by splitting some power into more intuitive Perks when designing the Heroes 
Steam version of Overwatch 2 still has problems,Competitiveoverwatch,122,1k8oa7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1k8oa7w/steam_version_of_overwatch_2_still_has_problems/,13,2025-04-26 23:55:36,"**I'm not sure where to post this, but I hope that someone from the development team or community managers will see this post and convey the issues with the game on Steam to the developers. As soon as Overwatch 2 was released on Steam, I immediately transitioned from BattleNet to Steam. Initially, there were no issues, but starting around the mid-season 6 patch (possibly from the start of season 7), various problems began to arise**

**1. «Unknown» player.** This issue appeared after the release of the game on Steam (around seasons 6-7) and persists to this day. I suspect that this problem occurs when a friend is on both BattleNet and Steam simultaneously (or due to the difference in usernames on Steam and BattleNet, the game doesn’t quite understand which one to read and just displays «unknown»)

**2. Issues with showing skins from Xbox Game Pass.** Unlike the BattleNet version, the Steam version does not display Game Pass skins, except for the permanent skins and currency. The skins that are granted temporarily do not appear in the collection. If they are equipped via the BattleNet version and then you open the Steam version, the standard character models skins replace them

**3. Display of report messages.** Such messages have been appearing more frequently now, but before, there were almost none in the Steam version. Every time I logged in through Battle.net, I would receive reports, but when playing through Steam, similar pop-up messages were nearly absent. As an experiment, I tried logging into both the BattleNet and Steam versions multiple times, and I found that I received these messages every time I logged into Battle.net, while they were absent in Steam

**4. Duplication of friends in the friends tab.** When playing through Steam, you might encounter a problem where one friend appears as two different entries with different usernames, and neither of them can be invited to the party. The game states that the player is not found. Moreover, a simple restart does not fix the problem, and it only gets resolved randomly (perhaps this has the same issue as the first case, where the game does not understand which username to read and displays both)

**5. Low resolution of the Steam icons in the friends tab**

**These issues have existed in the game for several months (or years) and still have not been fixed, or they are fixed only for that time, and something else gets broken in the next major patch. With this post, I want to highlight the existing problems in the Steam version of the game. It may not be a priority for the developers, but it seems to me that all of the aforementioned problems are not too difficult to resolve. I love and appreciate this game, as well as the development team for their hard work, and I would simply like these minor issues not to detract from the overall experience of the game!**

He answered so many questions, I missed a few at the end but not much, and I left out a few

Ginkam posted their own right as i finished mine, here [it is](https://x.com/ginkam0329/status/1915820848394735847) (organized by theme whereas mine is just the order during the stream, so it's messy)

* **Future plans:** I think I'll continue as progamer. I've delayed military so if I can resolve the current situation, I'll keep going
* **How is life as an ordinary person?:** It just feels like doing solo practice without getting a salary or team practice, other than that life is fine
* **When do you think this situation will be resolved?:** I don't know either, I really don't know so I have nothing to say
* **Favorite tank skins:** Winston - OW1 Gladiators / Doomfist - OW2 Gladiators / Sigma - OW2 Toronto / The rest - OW2 Florida Mayhem
* **Most fun tank and most carry potential tank:** Most fun - Winston / Most carry potential - Dva
* **Regions you want to play in if you return as a pro:** 1. Korea / 2. NA, Europe / 3. The rest
* **How was your time in the U.S.?:** Honestly in the U.S. I was able to focus better and it felt more like going to work than in Korea. But not being able to meet fans offline was a shame
* **TOEIC score?:** I never took it, I don't know vocabulary or grammar at all, I just speak English roughly, my level is probably elementary schooler?
* **Team you want to join:** I need to think about it. I've been taking a break for so long, I'm not sure if there's a team I want, my situation is complicated
* **Secret to reaching #1 tank in S15?:** Since I didn't do scrims, each ranked i'd lose was very stressful. It seems the energy I would've used in scrims ended up being used in ranked instead
* **How do you manage your mental during games?:** I think I cool off for about 10 minutes and then go again. If it's scrims, I try to resolve things by talking a lot with teammates
* **Don't you play horror games? (Chorong) :** Send a selfie, that's the real horror lol *\[q probably a ref to him playing horror games with falcons recently?\]*
* **Reason for deleting your Instagram posts?**: My mental broke down that day and I wanted a change in life. They're archived now, and if I feel better I'll restore everything. Don't worry haha
* **Best synergy with:** DPS - Mer1t / Support - Chorong
* **You were on the same team with Mer1t for a long time, any chance of being on the same team again?:** I can only give the same answer, I don’t know either
* **Future streaming plans?:** I'll come back when my mental health gets better, sorry
* **Any teams contacted you?:** A few after Toronto ended
* **Is there a pro you'd want to play with?:** No I've tried most of them. I'm a bit old now I pretty much know everyone now
* **Best thing about being back in Korea:** I met a lot of good people and had many chances to talk, it really made me happy
* **(ENG) Can I see you in Stockholm this year?:** idk about that sry TOT
* **Closest pro**: Donghak, Mag
* **Which Korean team are you closest with?:** Falcons and Raccoon, I’m close with pretty much everyone on those two teams
* **Post S15 thoughts on perks and ban system?:** Perks - really well made but couldn't they have been a bit more creative? There are some disappointing ones / Bans: 2 per team is too much. I don’t know how regular players are supposed to handle this, even pros don't have 2 bans each, feels too aggressive of a patch
* **Will you be playing in Stage 3?:** As I said before, I don't know even about Stage 2, Stage 3, or next year so I really can't say anything
* **How would you objectively rate your current skill level?**: #1 among the regular players
* **Is Mer1t also unable to play for the same reason?**: It’s not something I can speak on, each has their own reason
* **Did you watch the Hangzhou Clash?**: Yes, I did, congrats to Raccoon on the win
* **What’s your alcohol tolerance?** Usually 1.5 - 2 bottles of soju. If I’m feeling good, I drink 3 and pass out right in bed
* **That co-op game with Hanbin-Stalk3r-Chiyo was fun. Will there be another?** I don't have a say in this, I was only a substitute. If they call me I'll probably do it, I was very happy that they called me
* **Hey Jeongwan, let's drink (MCD)**: I don’t drink with this person. It was hell last time I drank with him, that's all
* **Why is your profile icon China?**: Back in 2023, 4 days before the OWL Grand Finals, we beat everyone in scrims (except Atlanta) and even won the championship after that. I didn't see a reason to change it, so I just left it \[i think it says he had while doing all of that and thus didn't change\]
* **Top 3 tanks you're most confident in right now**: Winston, Hazard, Sigma, Doomfist, Wrecking Ball
* **What team are you on?** I can't say, sorry. I might be on a team, or I might not, I don't know either
* **A Winston pro you felt a wall against:** After the 2023 OWL Midseason, we scrimmed Houston at the end of July. I got monkey-gapped and Gunba scolded me hard. I reviewed gameplay for an hour straight, then we beat Houston in the next tournament
* **Join a team that has a sub tank or a team that has no tank?** I want to go to a team that wants me. Not just a good team, but one that wants me
* **Difference between a good Winston and an average one?** A good one spends more time disrupting the backline and still come back alive. It's about whether he can force space with raw presence or not
* **Are you close with Euiseok/Fearless?** No, but when he announced his retirement, I sent him a long letter expressing respect. Then he said 'let's be like brothers' when we see each others later. I really hope I can meet Euiseok-hyung one day.
* **Most satisfying and disappointing match:** Most satisfying - when we beat Gladiators in 2023 and qualified for Midseason / Disappointing - losing 0-3 to Raccoon at 2024 OWCS Dallas Major
* **Do you have a match where you really carried that stands out?:** Honestly I don't think I've carried many, so nothing really comes to mind
* **What's the difference between Fearless' monkey and others?:** Beast-like decision-making
* **Which players are the toughest for you to face:** Shu, Fielder
* **From your experience as a tank, which enemy DPS hits the hardest?:** Stalk3r, LIP (Mer1t probably would hit the hardest though)
* **Closest foreign player:** Rupal
* **Current best player per role:** Raccoon, you have to respect tournament results
* **What ranks are you in DPS and Support?** DPS - GM4 / Support - GM5
* **Mer1t's Ana vs Someone's Ana:** Anyone who says Mer1t is ignorant
* **What do you think of Hanbin's Winston?** 2nd best Winston in the world right now
* **As the worlds' best flex tank, is there a tank you dislike or lack confidence in?** Don't like - Dva, feels boring after Winston / Not confident - Junkerqueen (if you've ever gone against Hanbin, you’ll know why)
* **Someone main dps vs Mer1t main tank:** In ranked, Someone DPS wins easily / In tournaments, Mer1t tank wins easily
* **Toughest opponents in the 2023 Gladiators match:** Lastro and Kevster
* **Which team had the best food?** Mayhem in 2022, the manager cooked for us and we had legendary meals
* **Mag Sigma vs. Donghak Sigma:** Mag Sigma (Donghak doesn't like playing Sigma)
* **If you get to play in a showmatch, what role and hero would you want?** Flex dps, Genji
* **Behind story of the legendary Runasapi at EWC semifinals:** Since we had to face Raccoon next if we won, I just saw Runasapi as a warm-up so I wasn't nervous
* **Korean national team roster that includes you?:** Raccoon + Someone co-streamer (goat roster)
* **When you were known as an Orisa main, was it because Orisa was fun?** Games are fun when you win, right? I kept winning so I kept playing her
* **The coach you've liked most:** Casores as a person, and in terms of game, Gunba. Gunba has his moments, but he reads the game well. If you win with him, you have to give him credit
* **A moment you felt exhausted by Overwatch:** Right now (Not because of the game itself but for other reasons)
* **Top tournament matches, one of your own and one from others:** Mine - 2023 vs Gladiators / Other - 2022 Shock vs Dallas. It will stay that way until my grandchildren's grandkids
* **Main tank you thought was great (besides yourself):** Fearless
* **Who's the GOAT of Overwatch?** Smurf I think. I respect other tournament wins, but I place the most value on Grand Finals. And he won it three times? No one can argue with that
* **A rookie you think is pretty good:** Infekted
* **When you were in Team CC, did you get any call-up offers?** No nothing came up
* **Scrim story from 2022 playoffs:** We beat Shock 6-0 in scrims then partied at the hotel and went to bed happy. Next day, they 6-0d us back. Hydron got sulky at Majed for not healing him.
* **Have you ever recommended a player who ended up joining the team?** Yeah a lot, I strongly recommended Mer1t and Chorong
* **Can Zeruhh be the next Kevster?** Objectively, I think it’s possible. I saw his Genji and he's so fast. My Genji feels like it weighs over 100kg but the way his slashes and dashes, feels like it is worth at least 1 Michelin star
* **Why did Atlanta collapse at the end of the 2023 season?** They got reverse-swept by Spark. If Atlanta had beaten Spark, the finals might've looked totally different
* **As of now, do you prefer the OWCS Finals or EWC?** For welfare and environment: EWC. In terms of personal prestige: OWCS Finals
* **I’m a Silver 2 tank, any recommendations?** Roadhog (I played a lot of Hog when I was low rank to climb up, good luck!)
* **Season you were most disappointed about:** Mayhem 2022, it feels like we could've gone further
* **Favorite memory from 2024 Toronto?:** In Stockholm, Sugarfree, Danny and Mer1t were bragging so much about running I couldn't stand it anymore, so I stirred them up to make them race, and Mer1t and Sugarfree got absolutely clapped lol
* **Are you going to Falcons?** This has been asked like 20 times already lol I’ll give you credit for persistence, but I honestly don't know
* **A time you really felt a skill gap going against another team/player:** During Team CC in 2021 when we scrimmed Shanghai, not sure if we were scrimming or being experimented on… it was just pain. Shanghai was insane
* **Someone-nim are you going to Falcons? (Shu):** Congrats on the win, hyung. Also it's my birthday, won't you say something to me?
* **What color is your hair right now?** Black.
* **Which team would you want to be a partner streamer with?:** Real Madrid (because they’re famous) or Al-Nassr (because I want to see Ronaldo once)
* **A duo game with Ronaldo vs. a 3-minute video call with Ronaldo:** Definitely the video call. If we duo, since I'm called ""someone"" he'll think I'm some random and move on lol
* **A skilled but toxic and uncommunicative teammate vs. less skilled teammate who communicates well:** I'll take the latter (Toxic = needs a smacking)
* **Why did you choose the name Someone?:** I explained it once during the GenG days but back then I made up a bs backstory. I sincerely apologize to the fans who believed it. The truth is, a friend had changed his nickname to ""Whatever"" and it sounded kinda cool. ""Whatever"" means ""anything"" so I thought I should go with either ""Someone"" or ""Everyone"". But if you type ""Everyone"" in the search bar, obviously ""MBC Everyone"" *\[a kr TV channel\]* is gonna come up, not me, so I went with ""Someone"". But before that, my nickname was ""Sexyguy"". I seriously tried to debut in Gen.G with that name but got insta-rejected
* **Who do you think are the GOATs by role?:** Tank - Smurf / DPS - Striker / Support - Viol2t. The Shock trio
* **Most fun meta during your time as a pro:** Winston-Sojourn-Reaper-Lucio-Kiriko
* **Will you teach Donghak your interview reactions?** Donghak is handsome so he doesn't need to do anything. I have to be a comedian to stand out but Donghak can just trust his face
* **Players you've stayed close with since Gen.G days:** Bliss, Stalk3r
* **Haksal vs. WhoRU?** HakRU
* **Did you buy the Someone dance Mei emote?** Yes, of course. It's the only remaining trace of me in Overwatch, so I had to get it"

From platinum to master in *statistics*,Competitiveoverwatch,96,1k63alw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k63alw,12,2025-04-23 18:19:16,"**Greetings fellow overwatch enjoyers,**

Recently I decided to track some data from my ranked support games (I'm a kiriko/moira player). Some of the stats I tracked include current rank; date and time; maps and objectives; start side (if applicable); hero picks; game time; win/loss.

The first figure I included is an overview of my rank progression throughout the games I played and also highlighting what hero I played during these games **(1)**.

I gathered data for nearly 200 games and decided, purely out of boredom, to create some nice plots/graphics for those nerdy enough to ponder over. I know there are some sites out there that also track your data and games, however I found that these didn't really *satisfy* me. Therefore, I decided to use R studio and create my own statistics (+figures) in order to test my own hypotheses.

With this in mind, I looked into  ...

* ... if there were specific days I usually win more games **(2)**
* ... if I end up winning more games before or after 17:00 (+ evening) **(3)**
* ... if I win more games with a friend I duo with **(4)**
* ... what hero performs better across tiers **(5)**
* ... if there are certain heroes on my team/enemy team I play better with/against **(6 + 7)**
* ... what the heroes with the highest pick rates are **(8)**
* ... what the usual game time is for a specific objective type **(9)**
* ... what maps and objectives I play the most (as I felt like I only got those goddamn push maps) **(10)**
* ... if matchmaking balances out your start side (attack vs. defence) **(10)**

I think I definitely got some interesting findings and really enjoyed making my own customised plots. However, I will leave the conclusions from these data open to your own interpretation, as that's more fun ... right?

Feel free to shoot me a message with any questions/suggestions/discussion points!  


***Notes and disclaimers:***  
*- Throughout the coding process, I used DeepSeek Generative AI to assist me in more complex analyses, as I only have experience with basic R coding*  
*- I didn't perform any statistical analyses as I am not acquainted enough to choose relevant/fitting tests, combined with the fact that I don't really care about it*  
*-  These plots portray my individual Overwatch ranked experience and are subject to variability*  
*- These data were collected from 10/03/2025 to 19/04/2025 and therefore fit entirely into OW2 season 15. I think this is relevant due to the meta of that season*  
*- I made these plots for fun, please keep that in mind :)*"
"Why can't ""Toggle Camera Shoulder"" in Stadium be bound to the same key as ""Perk Select""?",Competitiveoverwatch,76,1k5sqei,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1k5sqei/why_cant_toggle_camera_shoulder_in_stadium_be/,8,2025-04-23 08:49:10,"Overwatch generally allows duplicate keybinds for functions that don't conflict. For example most of the spectator/replay options can be duplicates of regular gameplay keybinds.

So I wonder why ""Toggle Camera Shoulder"" (under Options-Controls-Stadium) and ""Perk Select"" can't be bound to the same key. There's no perk in Stadium.

Has anyone found any documented/undocumented functionality of ""Perk Select"" in Stadium? Otherwise it'd be a perfect key (Alt by default on PC) for shoulder swap sitting there unused in Stadium."
How do you actually get better at Overwatch?,Competitiveoverwatch,5,1k5m3xu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1k5m3xu/how_do_you_actually_get_better_at_overwatch/,16,2025-04-23 02:31:33,"I originally posted this in a diferrent sub and got some really insightful replies that already changed how I approach the game. Wanted to share it here too and hear from a more hardcore competitive crowd.

Started playing Overwatch seriously about 3 years ago, and lately I’ve been feeling kinda stuck. Can't get out of Platinum for a while. I can hold my own, but I’m not seeing the kind of progress I hoped for. I'm even considering switching to Marvel Rivals just to feel I'm improving again!

I’ve thought about trying paid coaching, but it always felt kinda awkward or overpriced. Not sure if it actually helps or just ends up being more hype than value.

Not looking for “just play more” advice. I mean, what actually helped you improve? Coaching? Watching replays? Feedback from friends or teammates? Would love to hear what really worked for you—or what totally didn’t. Any content creators, coaches, or resources you’d actually recommend?

**P.S.** I’m also trying to figure out how people actually improve and whether coaching really helps. Made a quick 2-min survey—would mean a lot if you filled it out:

Overwatch 2 Match Tracker spreadsheet for season 16,Competitiveoverwatch,40,1k5d8ib,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1k5d8ib/overwatch_2_match_tracker_spreadsheet_for_season/,15,2025-04-22 20:11:48,"Hi, I'm back with a new version of my spreadsheet for season 16! Check the changelog below for the full list of changes. GL&HF with it!

----------------

I created a spreadsheet to track statistics about my competitive matches in Overwatch 2. Initially it was only to keep track of my match results and to easily see my win rates per role, but one thing led to another and now the spreadsheet does many more things.

You can for example track your win rates per role/map/day, rank changes, streaks and other things.

If you're interested in using my spreadsheet called **Overwatch 2 Match Tracker**, here is the link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jV0HoUvCSoExRau612IgXrOYM7T8MVsCABL0YdiY0fI/edit?usp=sharing.

The instructions in the sheet Home should speak for themselves, but please do let me know if something doesn't work or isn't clear!

----------------

**Changelog during season 15:**  
- Added a donation. Thank you!  
- Added the new Damage hero Freja.  
- Added another donation. Thank you!  
- Ticked the box for daylight saving/summer time.  
- Added a new feature: tracking MATCHES BY HERO BANS.  
- Hopefully fixed all formulas after adding the Hero bans column...  
- Replaced the Deathmatch graph with the 6v6 graph in the sheet Skill Rating.  
- Updated the dates for season 16.  "

Stadium Interview with Aaron Keller and Dylan Snyder,Competitiveoverwatch,88,1k39qx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1k39qx6/stadium_interview_with_aaron_keller_and_dylan/,31,2025-04-20 01:53:32,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwsUrsCX-II

__Stadium Mode Insights:__

- Development began in 2022, before OW2 launched. The original pitch came from Aaron's son, who prototyped an upgradable round-based mode called ""The Tower"".
- It's been in development for years, not a last-minute idea due to Rivals.
- Hero additions are coming every season. No exact count per season yet, but they teased ""more than one"" is likely.
- Stretch goal: Add all heroes eventually, but some (like Tracer) are harder to adapt due to lack of synergy with AP/UP systems.
- New maps each season, converted and brand-new ones. Maps are considered just as important as heroes right now.
- Custom games + feature expansion incoming, devs confirmed they’re working on bringing Stadium to custom lobbies and are interested in build-sharing systems (think workshop codes).
- Third-person camera was developed with help from Microsoft’s accessibility experts to avoid motion sickness.
- Potential to add 3rd-person to core OW in future, but would be carefully rolled out, starting with quick play if pursued.

__Fun Dev Bits:__

- Aaron’s favorite build? A barrier/speed/heal Rein support build dubbed “The Stellar Keller”.
- Dylan designed the Cassidy barrel roll damage build, yes, it slaps.
- They’re aware of goofy and creative community build names like “Morbin Time” for Moira.
- The devs love that people are experimenting and making silly builds just for fun.
- A feature to test builds 1v1 in a training range is being considered but not confirmed.

__Misc Highlights:__

- Aaron started in game dev by drawing boat blueprints as a kid; his first gig was on Soul Reaver, then WoW.
- Dylan used to be an actor and worked on Remnant: From the Ashes and Darksiders before OW.
- FOV debate: 70 FOV feels most ""natural"" for 3rd-person in Stadium.

---
Full Q/A:  

Q: What are you most excited about with Stadium finally coming out?

- Aaron Keller:
Mostly just excited to see players finally get their hands on it. The team has worked on it for a long time and just wants to see people having fun. Watching players enjoy the game is what excites the dev team most.

Q: How long has Stadium been in development?

- Aaron Keller:
The first pitch was made in August or September 2022, before Overwatch 2 launched. The idea was sparked by Aaron’s son, who created a prototype called ""The Tower."" It evolved significantly after the team got involved.

Q: Who were the first heroes added to the mode?

- Aaron Keller & Dylan Snyder:
The initial prototypes included Genji, Reaper, Soldier, Ramattra, Kiriko, and Ana. They wanted to start with classic staples from the game.

Q: Is there a specific ability or item you created yourself?

- Dylan Snyder:
Yes! He created Cassidy’s barrel roll power that damages enemies when rolling. Flats calls it “the barrel roll build.”

Q: Will heroes be added every season?

- Aaron Keller:
Yes, heroes will be added every season to Stadium. The exact number per season wasn't disclosed, but it will be more than one sometimes.

Q: Is the long-term goal to add all heroes?

- Aaron Keller:
Yes, but it's a stretch goal. Some heroes are more difficult to adapt, Tracer, for example, doesn't scale well with ability power. They’ll need to design custom items for some characters.

Q: Will there be patch notes for Stadium?

- Aaron Keller:
Yes, Stadium will have its own patch notes, alongside regular 5v5 and 6v6 patch notes.

Q: Will Stadium have consistent balance patches?

- Aaron Keller:
Yes. They’re planning to actively patch and support Stadium, especially in Season 16, to show how serious they are about it.

Q: Will Stadium get a build sharing system (like Deadlock’s loadouts)?

- Aaron Keller:
They love that idea and are seriously considering it, perhaps similar to workshop codes where you can import/export builds. No firm confirmation yet, but devs responded enthusiastically.

Q: Can we test builds with friends in training/custom games?

- Aaron Keller:
They're working on bringing Stadium to Custom Games, which would allow players to test builds freely. No date yet, but it's a priority.

Q: Will Stadium-exclusive maps ever come to core game modes?

- Aaron Keller:
Not currently planned. The maps weren’t designed with base game modes in mind, but they’re open to using future ones as a base for other modes. Stadium maps might fit Arcade or Arena modes.

Q: Will there be third-person support for heroes with transformations (Winston, Ramattra, Bastion)?

- Dylan Snyder:
They’ve consulted Microsoft accessibility experts on this. Custom animations and camera adjustments are used to reduce motion sickness. They haven’t tackled transformation-heavy heroes yet, but have plans in place.

Q: Could third-person be added to the base game?

- Aaron Keller:
Possibly. They’ll wait for community feedback after Stadium launches. If added, it would be gradual, maybe starting in Quick Play, then expanding. The team is split on whether it gives unfair advantages (e.g., peeking), but it’s being considered.

Q: What got you into game development?

- Dylan Snyder:
Started as an actor and film student. Eventually realized he loved games more and switched to game design school. He’s worked at NetherRealm, Gunfire Games, and Arkane before joining Overwatch.
- Aaron Keller:
He loved drawing spaces and floor plans as a kid and used 3D software early on. Landed his first job at Crystal Dynamics on Soul Reaver, then moved to Blizzard and worked on WoW.

I have recently watched a few matches and have seen pro players choosing the double slide perk. To me, it seemed pretty obvious that the Disruptor Shot perk was just flat out better. Honestly, the double slide perk feels like a nerf to me. It removes a lot of breakpoints for reaching high ground via single slide super jump, and the distance of each slide just feels minuscule. So, why are pros choosing it over the Disruptor Shot perk? "

If you could fill out this extremely short survey I would highly appreciate it. I am not asking any personal identifying questions, just questions about Overwatch, such as peak ranks in both OW1 and 2, along with what platform and an estimate of total playtime. Here is the link and thank you for all of your help. The more people that fill this out the better data I get. I've been sending them to official discords for overwatch, with permission from mods, and it hasn't been going so good, so hopefully a lot of people see it on here. If anyone has anyways I can make this seem more internet friendly please let me know in the comments. I've met a lot of people who are super skeptical about it but I truly only want what is on the form and want as many people to answer it. Thank you for your participation"

Violet birthday stream translation by @ginkam0329,Competitiveoverwatch,145,1k13v7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1k13v7h/violet_birthday_stream_translation_by_ginkam0329/,10,2025-04-17 05:59:39,"Following the official announcement of his contract termination with ZETA Division, Viol2t shared the following on his personal stream.  
""The happiest time in my pro career was during my 2019 days with the SF Shock,"" he recalled. ""It was my first shot at the OWL, and with great results, it left me with nothing but good memories. But I think I’ll miss 2024 and 2025 the most — playing offline matches in OWCS Korea and meeting so many fans. I don’t think I’ll get that kind of experience again.""  
1. On his appearance: ""People often say I look sleepy.""  
2. On his role: ""I don’t consider myself a 'main support.' I play every support hero — I’m just a support player, period.""  
3. On becoming a pro: ""I’ve loved games since I was born, and always dreamed of going pro. In high school, I chose a vocational school to study baking and pastry, mainly because unlike regular schools, it didn’t have mandatory night study. I needed that time to play games.""  
(In the past, most general high schools in South Korea required students to stay late for mandatory evening self-study sessions, often until 10 PM. Vocational schools, by contrast, generally had more flexible schedules.)  
4. Pre-match routine: ""I always go to the bathroom and drink coffee — gotta feel light and sharp.""  
5. On switching roles: ""If I had to switch roles, I’d want to be a tank. Tanks are extremely impactful in Overwatch 2, and I want to be remembered as a player who played every role on stage.""  
6. Widowmaker moment: ""During Stage 2 of OWL 2019, against Hangzhou Spark, I asked my teammates if I could play Widowmaker. They said go for it. I was nervous, but the shots landed — thank god.""  
7. Funny memory: ""Back at the 2019 SF Shock team house, ChoiHyoBin once cooked ramen late at night and left the windows wide open. A rat got in, and our manager Thugnasty scolded him hard.""  
8. Best synergy: ""Striker. We just clicked — maybe because he’s got such a unique personality. Lately, I’d say FiNN.""  
9. Between Crusty and Rascal: ""If I had to listen to one of them nag me for an hour, I’d pick Crusty. I’d probably end up fighting with Rascal, but I couldn’t do that with Crusty.""  
10. If he could go back in time: ""I’d go back to 2021 and win the Grand Finals — make it three straight OWL championships.""  
April 17 is Viol2t’s birthday.  
Happy birthday, Viol2t! "

Marvel Rivals made me get back into Overwatch,Competitiveoverwatch,1040,1k0phpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1k0phpu/marvel_rivals_made_me_get_back_into_overwatch/,311,2025-04-16 19:02:16,"I recently tried playing Marvel Rivals because of the hype around it. I thought the game was unpolished, unbalanced, and the hero abilities just weren’t as well designed and syngerestic as the abilities from Overwatch. The whole game wasn’t as well designed as Overwatch. You can say it’s new but that doesn’t matter. New or old I don’t want to play a worse game. The perceived shortcomings I saw in Marvel Rivals made me crave Overwatch. I haven’t played Overwatch in years really, just briefly when 2 came out. I tried playing OW again and I’ve been having a blast. Perks saved this game. They may seem like a small change to some but I think it’s a spectacular addition. The decision making and choices every game is an excellent dynamic. I like that it somewhat discourages swapping too. When 2 came out I played it briefly and didn’t like the 1 tank raid boss more than 2 tank but I realized it’s been fixed now and 1 tank is better than 2. 1 tank means less shields and more playmaking ability which means more fun. Well done Blizzard. Keep it up. "

Not happy about stadium mode.,Competitiveoverwatch,0,1junfuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1junfuf/not_happy_about_stadium_mode/,70,2025-04-08 22:17:57,"Looks like cobbled PVE content in the role 5v5 format, if the devs wanted to release a mode that was full on MOBA with lanes, bases, jungles, side objectives, and minions I would've appreciated the effort and given it a chance, but from what I've seen it looks objectively bad for the game.

1. A new gamemode would split the playerbase in a time where queue times are already long.
2. 5v5 players like to shoot their way out of everything on hitscan, they wont like playing a team builder with shop items and kit bloat.
3. 6v6 players wont play 5v5, they have their own gamemode now.
4. Theres no switching heroes during the match, so if you roll out on a certain pick and the enemy team has your counters, youre out of luck until the items are buyable.
5. Only 14 heroes are out on launch, that's less than half the available heroes in the base game.
6. Hero bans wont be part of the gamemode, theres only 5 DPS players and 4 available bans per game, in a mode that has 1-2-2 role lock.
7. They're obviously releasing this mode before its actually completed, its lazy and underthought.
8. Dev resources will be used to balance a whole other gamemode that has no real audience.
9. The whole thing is set up like a publicity stunt to get old and new players intrigued enough to play overwatch again when the casual playerbase have always abandoned the game in the past.
10. overwatch has historically hit its lowest points when chasing other games trends, role queue ruined overwatch 1, 5v5 ruined overwatch 2, and stadium will certainly be a massive misstep as time goes on.



Update: I just looked it up on youtube and the official overwatch stadium gameplay reveal has only 60k views after a month, 2 weeks out from full release.

I have no clue how to ask the question properly. 

We've seen 6v6 have pretty good numbered turnout (even if the matchmaking quality has been absolutely abysmal). Stadium is coming up and Blizzard mentioned they wanted it to be a competitive pillar. 

Will Overwatch Esports stick with being 5v5? Will 6v6 open queue potentially take over as the main format? Will there be Stadium tournaments when it launches for Blizzard to advertise the gamemode? 

I thought that Blizz would mainly be sticking 5v5 as their main competitive gamemode and everything else would be shaped around it, but I also must admit I'm concerned if Blizzard will be trying to balance 3 separate game modes on top of perks. Just wanna hear what other peoples opinions are on the competitive future of the game."

All changes made in the 6v6 test. (Spoiler: It's not just the December 17th 2024 patch with perks),Competitiveoverwatch,144,1jjpvhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1jjpvhh/all_changes_made_in_the_6v6_test_spoiler_its_not/,40,2025-03-25 19:05:09,"EDIT 1 (March 26th 2025): This post was made before the 25th of March 2025 hotfix patch, this post is still useful if you want to see the original changes made to the current 6v6 test.

EDIT 2 (April 5th 2025): I found some mistakes I've made in my patch, as well as some oversights, so I updated the pastebin and the patch below to include all the changes I missed, plus I've managed to confirm other changes I couldn't before.

EDIT 3 (April 9th 2025): Managed to finally confirm Tracer's falloff range and it's 10-20 meters. Additionally, I checked for Widow's projectile size on secondary fire and I am 90% sure it matches 5v5 live version.

EDIT 4 (April 13th 2025): Hopefully this is my last update, I found out the tank passive reduces ult charge generation by 20%, down from 25% in the previous test

Good evening Competitive Overwatch,  
If you played the current form of the 6v6 test, you probably noticed some differences between the version we played all the way back in December and the current test. And no, I'm not just talking about perks, rather the changes made to their base kits.

Intentional or not, Blizzard have made changes to the heroes' base kits (especially tanks), which mostly puts them in a unique balance spot between how they behaved in December, and their current state in 5v5 mid-season 15. So after a lot of testing myself with a friend, I found most, if not all of the changes made to this version of 6v6. It is also important to note that there are some changes I couldn't verify and they are written as such below.

I have made 2 versions of the list of changes, one comparing it with the December 17th, 2024 patch, the other comparing it with the live version, both written down as if they are blizzard patch notes. The comparison between it and the live game will be written down in this post, meanwhile the comparison between the original 6v6 patch will be written down in a pastebin.

Also, none of the lists include perks due to the extra amount of time it would have taken me to test it, as well as not feeling any different (from my experiences). And feel free to double check all of my findings and/or point out any mistakes I've made, or even add to what I already have.

Lastly, before reading all the changes, I want to note that I am not a blizzard developer. I have no idea if these changes were made intentionally, or if they simply forgotten to change them in the first place (maybe even both). From what I know, all of these changes could be patched out as a bug fix.

[First 6v6 patch on December 17th 2024 if you need a refresher](https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/December_17,_2024_Patch)

Patch comparison between the December 17th 2024 patch and this 6v6 test: [https://pastebin.com/7ijkaah6](https://pastebin.com/7ijkaah6)

NOTE: Most of the changes overall are reverts to some abilities to behave similarly to/exactly like the 5v5 live version.

Incorporating certain perks on base kit ideas (and replacement ideas),Competitiveoverwatch,0,1jjf95a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1jjf95a/incorporating_certain_perks_on_base_kit_ideas_and/,12,2025-03-25 10:17:54,"Certain perks feel like they should be incorporated into the base kit, particularly if they are quality of life changes or add new abilities. In addition to adding the perks to the base kit, I will also balance them accordingly, and give suggestions for the replacement. While I do want to share my ideas, I also want to hear your thoughts on these ideas, both positive and negative.

**Reaper**

**Dire Triggers** is now base kit, but has a 6 second cooldown instead of 4 seconds. This perk fixes Reaper's biggest weakness and makes his gameplan way more fun and less painfully linear, so I'm puzzled as for why this is a major perk instead of minor, let alone not base kit. It was also just weird that he lacked a secondary fire until now, and once he finally gets one it's locked for most of the match. The increased cooldown is in line with other cooldown-based damaging secondary fires like Orisa, Echo, and Soldier.

The replacement is **Swift Step**, which replaces the 1.15 second animation before teleporting with a 0.2-0.5 second wind up time. I feel like Shadow Step is only good for rollouts, but is pretty bad for escaping or using in the middle of the fight. Making the teleport startup near-instant makes it useful for teleporting behind enemies in the middle of a fight, or as a backup escape if Wraith Form is on cooldown. The short wind-up time still exists to make it fair, but the goal is for teleporting to take less than a second since currently Shadow Step feels clunky.

**Bastion**

Bastion, like Reaper and Venture, was missing an ability before perks. **Self-Repair** is now a base kit ability, but only heals 30 health per second without the perk, and the current 90 with the perk (3x increase). With the maximum heal being 3.3 seconds, he can only heal 99 before recharging at base, while he can heal 297 with the perk. Since he lost self repair initially because he used to be overpowered, the goal is to make the base heal not even able to heal half of his health at base without recharging, but return it to its full heal power with the perk. Additionally, without the perk Bastion's move speed is reduced by 35% without the perk, but can move at normal speed during self repair with the perk, a callback to how at launch Bastion was immobile while healing. The new name is the least importamt part, but I guess **Improved Repair** works.

**Lifeweaver**

**Lifeweaving** is pretty underwhelming, so it is now a minor perk, replacing **Cleansing Grasp**, which now exists at base; even with it, Lifeweaver is still just kind of a worse Kiriko. 

The new major perk is **Back to Normal**, which allows allies who had been life gripped to teleport back to the location they were gripped from, 1-2 seconds after being gripped, using the interact key; a hologram shows during these 1-2 seconds so that both your team and the enemy know where you'll be heading. It's a pretty common occurence for a life grip to screw players out of a kill, so giving players a choice to teleport back to their previous location would alleviate that issue. I could see a teleport being too strong as a minor perk, hence why I shuffled Lifeweaving around.

**Roadhog**

This one's simple. **Scrap Hook** now exists at base, removing the requirement to reload if you unloaded all of your ammo. The new perk, with the same name, just reloads all ammo instead of just 2. It's a similar situation to Torb's Fully Loaded, which reloads 6 with base Overload and 18 with the perk.

**Pharah**

Being able to move during Barrage should be a thing at base, not a park. Full movement is a bit too good at base, so Pharah instead can move with a 50% penalty during Barrage, while the perk gives her full movement speed again. 

However, **Drift Thrusters** now does a second thing: Hover Jets regenerate at 10% fuel per second when falling (a quarter of the 40% while on the ground). Regenerating fuel in midair was an old feature, which seems to be a running theme with perks. I only made her regeneration 10% per second while in the air so she's not airborne all the time, she can just stay in the air for longer.

**Soldier: 76**

Soldier can reload while sprinting at base. Simple quality of life change that should probably not be locked behind a perk. **Agility Training** maintains its 20% faster sprint, but the reload during sprint is replaced by being able to use Helix Rockets during Sprint. Since it's on a 6 second cooldown, it shouldn't be too spammy.

**Cassidy**

Okay, this one isn't really adding the perk at base, just taking what I like about the **Quick Draw** perk while hopefully fixing people's issues with how the perk works. At base, Fan the Hammer can be cancelled with Primary Fire; the primary use I get from Quick Draw is bursting with secondary first then primary for a faster kill. 

With the perk, holding down Secondary Fire continues using Fan the Hammer until the button is let go. I see a lot of people complain about needing to repeatedly tap the button, which is why holding allows for the old Fan the Hammer, just with crits and less recoil."
Freja's high SELF-Damage makes little sense from both gameplay and lore perspectives.,Competitiveoverwatch,74,1jj119i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1jj119i/frejas_high_selfdamage_makes_little_sense_from/,38,2025-03-24 21:29:25,"Freja's right click explosion deals a maximum of 45 damage out of her 225 total health; her bola deals up to 50. For reference, Pharah's rocket only deals up to 20 damage to herself while Zarya right click deals 27-55 depending on charge. All other heroes with explosive *weapons* (as opposed to ability or ult)\*: Sigma (weapon-only), Junkrat, Symmetra and Venture, deal no self-damage.

From a gameplay perspective, in close quarter combat her right click is already at a disadvantage compared to her left click, without the self-damage:

1. Less consistent
2. Makes her a sitting duck during the wind-up
3. Left click's main downside, spread, is less relevant at close range

Even if you judged the initial distance well, since right click explosion depends on opponent location and has a delay, it can't always be avoided. Imagine an Ashe or Widowmaker, after they took the risk to use right click (instead of the more consistent left click) and landed a sick 180 with 40 hp left, they died afterward to its self-damage. It would be underwhelming.

From a lore-perspective, we know Freja built her weaponry to be non-lethal. In her cinematic her bolts stunned Maximilien's goons instead of killing them, and her bola kept alive the people she initially brought with her. It'd be hard to believe she did all this with weapons so dangerous she can't even prevent from damaging herself. She ought to take a page from her colleague at Overwatch Sojourn, who can safely pass through her own Disruptor Shot.

---

Appendix: List of all heroes with explosive weapons and the self-damage they take from them.

\* Some may argue Freja's secondary fire is an ability, but having an ammo pool (of 1) and the frequency at which you can fire it do make it a weapon.

|---|---|
|Sigma|0%|
|Zarya|50%|
|Freja|50%|
|Junkrat|0%|
|Pharah|25%|

Since Freja has a different zoom ratio than Ashe/Ana/Widow, she needs a different relative sens to get 1:1.

* Primary fire has scaling spread, first 2 shots is almost pinpoint and 3-4 shots reasonably accurate, so always weave your shots
* Bola charge activates bullet time
* Bola final blow counts toward your passive. Passive is buffered if ultimate is available, giving you 25% immediately after using ult.
* Free dash (perk) expire when updraft cd is 9 secs (aka 3 seconds)
* For some reason, holding bullet time right after pressing updraft gives you a very slight amount of additional height

**IMPORTANT EDIT**: As someone pointed out, this is for a specific type of aim at 103FoV. I decided to make the equivalent of this old calculator [https://jscalc-blog.com/overwatch-zoom-sensitivity-calculator/](https://jscalc-blog.com/overwatch-zoom-sensitivity-calculator/), to cover different scenarios and adding Freja: [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vdoruzv6h3](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vdoruzv6h3) .

The sens I showed **previously, now edited** above is for FULL SCREEN FLICK which is not realistic, so I've edited it to the microflick type (where horizontal distance is set to \~0). The current numbers should be equivalent to the familiar 51.46 / 37.89 sens on Ashe/Widow."
Freja Abilities and Perks,Competitiveoverwatch,518,1jgppw2,https://i.redd.it/0idwg9q9k3qe1.jpeg,79,2025-03-21 20:47:57,Notably most of her perks are different from what was originally reported. 
"Perks, Role Q 5v5, Open Q 6v6, and stadium and are the future of OW",Competitiveoverwatch,147,1jg44ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1jg44ci/perks_role_q_5v5_open_q_6v6_and_stadium_and_are/,81,2025-03-21 01:23:25,"I am somebody who whole heartedly loves playing 5v5. I enjoy tanking more in 5v5 and the fights feel like they flow better. However, this iteration of 6v6 might be the best one yet. There’s a lot of minor issues with it but I would definitely play 6v6 open queue over 5v5 open queue. With Stadium coming up I can see a world where 5v5 and 6v6 are able to coexist in this same format, and have Stadium be the more casual “for fun” mode. 

Even if the player base peters out for 6v6 or maybe it’s just too much work; I feel like Overwatch has been in a really strong upward trend in terms of player reception and fun. Realistically nothing changed from the last season besides perks but they did so much to make things fun without breaking much. "

I’ve missed being a Flex player,Competitiveoverwatch,2,1jf0n7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1jf0n7g/ive_missed_being_a_flex_player/,7,2025-03-19 17:10:41,"Throughout Overwatch’s history I have felt the transitions to role queue and 5v5 were overall the right decision for the game but after playing this comp 6v6 open queue I really forgot how much fun flexing around roles was. 

I think especially in today’s Overwatch it is so much more interesting too with the character cast we have and perks. The most notable comps I have enjoyed are triple support Illari, healer perk Sombra, and Doom as a damage heavy tank. These strategies have really made 6v6 feel so much nicer to me."
Is 6v6 Open Queue 2 Tanks max the way?,Competitiveoverwatch,36,1jezjtg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1jezjtg/is_6v6_open_queue_2_tanks_max_the_way/,110,2025-03-19 16:24:12,"Let me start be prefacing, its probably way to early to give an accurate opinion on the new 6v6 test, as generally anything that mixes up the game a lot makes it feel more fun for a while.   


However, I feel like the 6v6 open queue with 2 Max tanks is such a simple yet effective solution to the issues Overwatch has had, and so far it feels great! You receive the faster queue time benefits of Open Queue, while also bringing in some needed restriction with 2 tank limit. Part of me wonders if they could even straight up combine 2-2-2 & open queue to get the best of both worlds. The biggest issue of course then would be how do people seamlessly swap roles as needed during a match. If that isn‘t solvable though, I think the 2 tank limit might be enough. Sure there is a likelihood that +3 supports could become oppressive like in another game, but I think that is an easier solution to fix than queue times or the pains 5v5 cause. 

As a tank myself, I enjoyed 5v5 for a while, but the burden of solo tanking started to become a huge drag & I know other roles dont particularly enjoy fighting the solo tank raid boss that 5v5 requires. I hope the team seriously considers a full swap back to 6v6 at this point. I know many are still skeptical of open queue even with the 2 tank limit, but I’m surprised how good it has felt so far."

Moving Barrage shouldn't be a perk,Competitiveoverwatch,0,1jdccr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1jdccr1/moving_barrage_shouldnt_be_a_perk/,88,2025-03-17 14:15:06,"One of Pharah's minor perks needs to be reworked. The ability to move during barrage is too good and I'm pretty confident it's the overwhelming choice among players, certainly among pros. There have been a lot of games where I hold barrage until I hit 2-3 more rockets just so it isn't an instant death button. Minor perks are supposed to come up around your first ultimate anyways so it feels like it's always better than the alternative. The shields perk isn't even that bad it was a nice buffer using it in Junkenstien's Lab but it's just not as useful as its alternative. Moreover idk how you really tune either in any direction to try and balance them. You could scrap the shields perk and just go for another more equal alternative but were I the devs I'd just make moving barrage part of the kit since it's so common now anyways and give her a different minor perk. If everyone takes moving barrage and it's almost always available by the first ult anyways I think it should just be a QoL change. Not that Pharah needs buffs in my opinion.

What other perks are so ubiquitously good QoL and hard to balance that they should just be a part of the base kit? Overload reloading rivet gun ammo comes to mind"

Is Tracer not just a must pick on Push maps?,Competitiveoverwatch,133,1jc5dj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1jc5dj5/is_tracer_not_just_a_must_pick_on_push_maps/,37,2025-03-15 22:14:54,"Since the Percocet update, I have yet to actually lose a Push map. Be it ranked, or scrims. Even pre-Oxycodone, my win rate on push was absurd. I genuinely think Tracer kind of just breaks this gamemode.

For one, her ability to stall, push, hold, or straight up yoink the robot is ridiculous. You can't do this in any other game mode. Lose a team fight but lose virtually no progress whatsoever. You can flip the point in control/flash but the other team can afford to lose progress there. Not on push 


There's also the issue of spawns making trades vital in push. If you lose the fight, but kill 2 or 3, you give yourself a huge advantage for the next one. This advantage gets even better the later into the round you are. This is where her perks come into it, cause flashback and blink pack make her not just invincible, but always good for her ones. Combined with the flanky nature of every single push map (save for maybe colosseo, you're just always going to find a trade.

Korea and China should swap for next stage,Competitiveoverwatch,76,1jbap29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1jbap29/korea_and_china_should_swap_for_next_stage/,12,2025-03-14 19:30:59,"It’s been clear since the start of OWCS that  the “top two of Asia” would be the same as the “top two of Korea”. The fact that every single Asia Main Event has gone exactly this way proves it. 

Do we really need to see the best 4 teams in Korea completely destroy the best 2 teams in the Pacific and Japan on repeat every stage? 

All this leads to is seeing the same four Korea teams play each other over and over and over again. We see the same four teams play each other in the:   
- Korea Group Stage  
- Korea Seeding Stage  
- Korea Playoffs  
- Asia Group Stage  
- Asia Playoffs  
Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy watching the best teams in the world play Overwatch at the highest level, but do we really need to see WAY play against Team Falcons 7 or 8 times in the span of two months? 

After this stage we’ll get a better feel for how China as a region is able to stack up globally, and I fully believe that the best China team will be competitive against the best Korea teams, but wouldn’t it be so much better if China took Koreas place in the Asia Region? The Chinese teams can battle it out against the Pacific and Japan teams, which would almost certainly lead to more competitive matches than with Korea. Just give Korea two spots at LAN, determined by the Korea Playoffs. 

The end product would probably be the same, with two Korea teams and two Chinese teams, but there would be a bigger opportunity for the best non-Korean APAC teams to be included. "

Lifeweaver Rework Concept,Competitiveoverwatch,14,1j754hl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1j754hl/lifeweaver_rework_concept/,4,2025-03-09 11:47:19,"**Thorn Gun**

* Add a variation of his current Superbloom perk to the base behaviour of the gun.
* Instead of triggering explosions per hit, trigger them when weaver reloads, damaging based on how many needles have hit. 
* Need more needles to do max damage versus a tank in role queue.

Superbloom finally adds something interesting to his gun that makes his character mildly interesting to shoot with. Lean into it. 

**Healing Blossoms**

* Reduce clip size to 4.
* Heal instantly for 20 then 50 for 2s.
* Reloads naturally over time, like Doomfist primary. 
* Charging the thorns no longer increases their heal, but instead makes them reload faster. 

Let’s face it: Weaver’s current healing loop is boring, has no skill expression involved, and prevents him from doing more interesting things with his time. Giving him a much smaller regenerating clip size to manage would add resource management while also freeing him up to shoot more often rather than locking him into the charging and releasing loop constantly. It would also help him to compete with Brigitte as a support pairing for Genji, Tracer and Echo. 

**Life Grip**

* Reworked to be functionally similar to a Zarya bubble - cleansing its target then protecting them from damage.
* Absorbs up to 125 damage on its target and lasts up to 2.25 seconds. 
* When broken, pulls the target to Lifeweaver.
* Environmental damage that would otherwise be lethal just breaks the bubble and triggers the pull.

(Implementation detail - happens in two steps, first to the location where they were the button was pressed, then to the location weaver was when he pressed it.  Avoids issues with LOS when the target goes around corners.) 

Weaver *needs* something with proactive potential in his kit, which this would provide by allowing him to use it on DPS heroes to execute high risk dives with safety. 

It would be more interactive for enemies, since if it was poorly timed, they could just wait out the bubble to be able to kill its target. Alternatively, breaking the bubble would force out the bubbled target, offering some counterplay to its dives. 

**Tree of Life:**

* Conversion rate of health to overhealth is 1:1.
* First pulse now heals everyone to full and grants the full overhealth. Successive pulses unchanged. 

This ultimate is just underpowered. This would at least make it halfway decent at saving people and remotely comparable to Brigitte’s rally. 

Petal platform is fine. 

**Minor Perks**

* Replace Cleansing Grip: Gripped targets gain healing and a speed boost after pull ends.
* Replace Life Cycle: Roots of life. A long wall of roots sprouts in front of Lifeweaver, continuing until it hits a wall. 

The first perk solves a major issue for weaver which is that pulling your teammates to safety makes your team fight 4v5 for a few seconds while the saved hero rejoins the fight. A few seconds can often matter, especially when the tank is the one being pulled. This makes it easier for them to run back into the fight as fast as possible. 

The second option modifies the ultimate to lean into the potential of using it as a wall. Currently its shape means that it can only wall off targets in a very limited set of areas. A wall emerging from weaver and extending as far as it needs to extend would both make it easier to fight inside the area of effect of the healing, easier to place it in a way that covers your whole team, and easier to break up the fight to trap enemies with it. In Lifeweaver spirit, it would also make it easier to accidentally fuck over a teammate. This one is potentially extremely powerful, but as an ultimate based perk it will only be used a handful of times per game. 

**Major Perks**

* Replace Life weaving: Triggering a max damage superbloom heals Lifeweaver and restores healing blossom charges. 
* Replace superbloom: Reduce healing blossom capacity to three and slow their passive regeneration, but blossoms now bounce to a second teammate.

The first option heavily improves the healing output of DPS weaver by providing sustain when he engages divers or during brawls. 

The second option lets weaver work better for compositions where he has multiple healing targets, but forces him to spend more time manually charging his healing."

The 750 game wins for t500 feels kind of bad,Competitiveoverwatch,77,1j4ipfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1j4ipfj/the_750_game_wins_for_t500_feels_kind_of_bad/,73,2025-03-06 01:30:25,"I understand that the leaderboard for top 500 was riddled with multiple accounts and now you only see like a couple of the same player’s accounts but man that require feels like ass. 

Me and my friend have played Overwatch since the first season and we used to play competitive almost every day. When Overwatch 2 came out we mainly played quick play but last season we said fuck it and decided to climb to try to hit top500. Truth be told it didn’t take long to get there cause our mmr was already high and placements were a breeze. The 25 game wins were a bit more difficult as we got higher in rank but we managed to get high enough to be on the leaderboard. 

Then we find out that the 750 ranked win requirements didn’t take into account OW1 ranked wins. This meant that we needed to get HUNDREDS of WINS in top500. The shitty part about this is as we win we get longer queue times and harder matches. The worst part really is the fact that we would fight very clearly worse players than us and they get the fucking number and titles. 

My friend decided to rank up with the reset and he had to deal with shit like OWCS duo/stacks. Having to play the game in high ELO with none of the recognition from the game is really just demoralizing. I’m still gonna rank and I’m having fun most of the time, but man it just fuckin sucks. "

PSA: Check Your Refresh Rate – Don't Get Stuck at 60 Hz,Competitiveoverwatch,104,1j28rfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1j28rfd/psa_check_your_refresh_rate_dont_get_stuck_at_60/,58,2025-03-03 03:51:34,"A buddy of mine moved from console to PC and has been playing Overwatch 2 with me pretty regularly over the past year. Just today, I discovered he had been playing at 60 Hz on a 144 Hz monitor this whole time just using default settings. I had a good laugh and walked him through optimizing everything.

His reaction when he finally experienced the full 144 Hz was priceless to say the least.

This might seem obvious to us seasoned PC players, but if you’re newer to PC, make sure you’re actually using your monitor’s full refresh rate. Double check your game (Settings > Video > Resolution > Select the highest resolution with the highest Hz in brackets) and system (Nvidia control panel) settings - it makes a huge difference in how smooth your game feels!

A Discussion on Ana's Self-Nano Perk,Competitiveoverwatch,154,1j24efo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1j24efo/a_discussion_on_anas_selfnano_perk/,115,2025-03-03 00:13:33,"Reposting due to rule #2.

It is evident that perks, ultimately, should be something that either adds some nuance or fun to a character, or something that rewards good play. Ana's major perk that lets her nano herself is not a perk that fits into the above categories, but another ghastly one altogether: free value.

Needless to say this perk is disgustingly good. Now instead of one super-soldier, you have two on the team, with one guaranteed to be an infinite range hitscan that is now immortal with an iota of peel from a fellow support.

Glad to hear any thoughts surrounding this, personally I am partial to removing it altogether."

Why perk system is wrong on a philosophical level despite being able to save OW2 pt.3,Competitiveoverwatch,0,1j1p3qh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1j1p3qh/why_perk_system_is_wrong_on_a_philosophical_level/,19,2025-03-02 12:46:21,"Here is part 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1ivqf5t/why\_perk\_system\_is\_wrong\_on\_a\_philosophical\_level/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1ivqf5t/why_perk_system_is_wrong_on_a_philosophical_level/)

Here is part 2: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1izl7ht/why\_perk\_system\_is\_wrong\_on\_a\_philosophical\_level/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1izl7ht/why_perk_system_is_wrong_on_a_philosophical_level/)

First, I want address my last post. I was not saying all the perks and abilities should fit the lore. That's not what I was trying to say. I was trying to say that perks and abilities should fit the characters and somewhat make sense for those characters. For example, you can make bastion fly, but it doesn't make sense for bastion's character. Wether it was in the robots in rein cinematic or bastion's own cinematic, bastion was portrayed as a slow target with heavy weaponry. Smart bomb just doesn't make sense for bastion. I can excuse bomb jump because self-knockback tech(helix jump, canon jump, etc) is a quite universal wackiness in ow. However, devs specifically going out their way to make bastion fly with bomb jump is just undermining his character and lore. Bastion is just not supposed to do that.

Also, I want to address some perks that I actually like and think fit the character: sigma levitation, mercy flashheal, mauga two hearts, kiriko fortune teller, soldier agility training, etc. (Just for clarification, liking these perks does not mean I like the perk system, and they are part of the reasons why the perk system is bad)

  
Anyway, that's not the point of this post. In part 3, I want to talk about in-game fantasy, which is tied to playstyles instead of characters as people. For this one, I will use roadhog's pig pen as the primary example. Pig pen has always been a mind ever since its existence. It has never been a poking tool. Giving hog the ability to throw it like a ram vortex just kills the ability's identity completely. It essentially turns the ability into a worse ram vortex with less range and no anti-air. Beyond hog himself, it is also unhealthy for the game to have abilities being similar to each other. I don't think I need to further elaborate this point.

Another example would be sombra with her white hat perk. Sombra has always been able to heal people by hacking health packs, but teammates still needed to find and take the health packs by themselves. Sombra merely made it easier for them. The new white hat thing just shifts Sombra's entire identity and gameplay loop. Just to clarify, I am not against changing sombra's identity. I know how much ow community despise her, but perks is not a place for devs to do that. Changing a character's identity in the final 4/5 segment of the game is pure madness. I really want to go deeper into it and how stupid it is, but I'll save it for part 4.

There are some other perks that undermine in-game fantasies, but most of them are to a less degree or have the basic ideas covered by the two examples already, so I will keep this post short."

New Dva Minor Perk Ideas,Competitiveoverwatch,32,1izy243,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1izy243/new_dva_minor_perk_ideas/,17,2025-02-28 04:09:03,"Both of Dva's current minor perks aim to help her when she is out of mech, but they are kind of boring and hard to feel the impact of. I've created some new perks that buff baby Dva like the devs want, while also being a little bit more fun and interactive than what she has now. Both give her a new ability when she is demeched that lets players choose how they want to play as baby Dva.



**Minor Perk 1 - Lag Switch**

**New Ability 1:** Pilot Dva tosses a grenade that creates a small slowing and damaging field wherever it lands.

(A more offensive option for her. She can throw it into a crowd of enemies for extra ult charge, or can use it to help win a 1v1 duel. She can also use it directly after launching Self Destruct in the hopes of slowing an enemy enough for them to get hit by the explosion.)



**Minor Perk 2 - Bye Bye Baby**

**New Ability 1:** Pilot Dva consumes a pill that will instantly kill her after 2 seconds. If she dies this way, she will have 2 seconds shaved off her respawn timer.

(Allows the player to stop any potential stagger. Enemies can stop her from getting the reduced spawn time if they kill her before the pill activates. Either way, Dva dies and the stagger is prevented.)"

- Alec Dawson, Lead Gameplay Designer
- Kenny Hudson, Senior Game Producer
- Scott Kennedy, Hero Designer (AKA Custa, former OWL player and talent)

HyPn0MaN
> Which perks had the highest impact on hero performance? Will perks have a higher priority in terms of balance than base hero perks, or will we see a combination of both going forward?

Alec: 

Some of the winners so far have been Ana, Bastion, Pharah, Ramattra, and Winston. When it comes to individual perks: Ramattra's Vengeful Vortex, Mauga's Firewalker, Zarya's Energy Lance, and Soldier 76's Agility training have all been quite impactful. It's important though to look at the combination of your Minor and Major perks, what rank thresholds players are using them at, and how quickly a hero is gaining their perks. There's still quite a bit for us to dig through there!

In the immediate, we mostly plan on balancing perks in order to make them feel more impactful. There will still be some core kit tuning alongside that, but there's still a meaningful amount of change we want to inject into the system throughout the next few patches. Tuning to perks and actual perk swaps (hoping for some in 16.0) are included in that.

Triskan
> Clash can be really fun when the stars align. Anything you can share about what you plan to do with the mode in the future?

> I was really looking forward to see the old 2CP maps reworked. Oh, and speaking of old maps, any hope for Gothenburg to get a second life one day?

Alec: 

Like you, I also believe Clash is awesome when it all comes together! We actually spent a good amount of time on Clash's scoring before we made the decision to pull it from Competitive. Even with scoring changes, we believed the mode needed some fundamental geo changes to points A+E to perform better as a Competitive mode. Currently we are experimenting with building another Clash map from the ground up with a different approach to the layout to see if that solves some of the core issues the mode has. That's all very early, but hopefully some significant geo changes along with scoring changes can get Clash into a great spot.

banethor88
> Kudos to the dev team for trying something so different. For me it seems to be a hit already and I can't wait to get my hands on stadium

> 1. Chicken or egg question - did Junkenstein revenge's success serve as the spark for building a new game mode with talents more permanently into the game? Or was this always in the back of mind given the amount of work that has gone into talents since OW2's development?

> 2. What was the thinking behind limiting perks down to just 2X2 choices and is this something that you think could change in the future? I personally really enjoyed how more choices really lead to different early and late game experiences

Alec

1. Actually neither! The true impetus for this was our need for a game system layer to introduce more change into the core game. Having some talents to pull from was nice to have but a large majority of the perks were built for the perk system specifically. The team had gotten really great at expanding kits, so there was plenty of good experience for us to bring good learnings into building perks. Junkenstein's Lab gave us more signal for Stadium and how much we could expand the bounds of an Overwatch match while still making it feel like Overwatch.
2. We played with a number of different iterations. Originally we had three levels but there was no choice, didn't feel very different. Some iterations later we gave players their Minor Perks passively but you had a choice between two Major Perks later on in the game. We really liked the choice that gave, so decided to bring it in earlier at the Minor Perk level. Overall, we felt this was the right amount of change to introduce initially. We were changing some of fundamentals of how Overwatch worked and were trying to measure how much we could disrupt that. Maybe we could've gone even farther, but I think we are in a good place for now and with time we'll see how far the playerbase wants us to take systems like this.

ApostLeOW 
> How does the team decided who gets the ""fun perks"", like (pharah, Kiriko, ana), who gets the ""new ability"" perks, (bastion, orisa, torbjorn), and who just gets number buffs? (Reaper, Genji) Are the number buffs just placeholders, with plans to go more extreme in the future to match the other heroes?

Alec

Well the goal overall is to make fun perks for every hero! That can be more difficult on certain heroes though, as boosting certain elements of their kits can cause issues. Currently, the number buff perks are some of the perks we like the least and plan on changing a handful of those over time. This initial launch has given us plenty of signal on which perk combinations players find compelling and which ones they don't!

Think it's important for us to stay true to our values for Minor and Major perks. Your Minor Perks are supposed to be lighter, nice little upgrades. Your Major Perks are supposed to be transformative. We have some work to hit that goal for all of the heroes and offering more transformative Major Perks.

RobManfredsFixer
> Do you view perks as a way to limit the counterpicking and power spikes of certain heroes? If so, do you think they have shown early signs of achieving that and what adjustments would you make going forward? Any examples of heroes you'd want to shore up in that respect?

Alec

We did want to add more friction to counterswapping and we've seen that drop quite a bit since Season 15's launch. It'll be some time before players settle on how much less they want to counterswap but in Ranked Role Queue we've seen players swap about 25% less and more so at the highest ranks (Masters+ players swap much more than the ranks below that).
 
For power spikes, the goal of the perk system isn't to limit power spikes. We actually introduced more power spikes and hopefully more texture to your individual hero's moment to moment gameplay through the perks system. We think a number of our heroes needed bigger moments than they had previously.

Going forward, we are looking at raising up some of the less impactful perks and making sure you feel there's a real choice between your Minors and Majors. We have a lot of opportunity to make that choice more interesting by cutting out some of perks players aren't gravitating towards. Things like Roadhog's increased Pig Pen throw distance.

No32
> In the Spotlight, Alec mentioned a “refresh” of the perks in the middle of the year. Does that mean 4 brand new perks for everyone? Saw someone mention Aaron said something along those lines but couldn’t find where.
> 
> Or is it more like a few perks will be changed out or tweaked if desperately needed here and there before the refresh, and the refresh is more thorough for perks that are less lopsided and not 4 brand new perks for everyone?

Alec

The goal there would be that every hero gets at least one new perk to play with! Still scoping out what that refresh would look like for Season 18, but somewhere around 25-50% of the perks changing (some being completely new and some receiving significant tuning). If we have perks that players really love, we don't want to immediately remove those and the refresh would be looking at perks that are more middling in interest.
 
We'd also like to evaluate how the perks system functions overall at that point too. That could include changes to the catchup mechanics, gain rates, or even a starting level choice. Those are fairly early discussions though and how this season goes will give us good insight of where to take perks next.

OnceToldTale
> What were some interesting perks that the team scrapped along the way?

Alec

We played with a variety of movement perks for heroes that don't have much mobility. We wanted to see if we could do a movement perk for Torbjorn. I think it only lasted a playtest or two but Torbjorn could launch himself off of his turret by double jumping on it. And the idea was that if you had the Sticky Turret, you could change the angle of that leap and catapult yourself into backlines. Maybe we will come back to that one day, was certainly silly!

Nobbs89
> Are there any ideas to make Mystery Heroes mode less stomping with new perks? Currently perk system is another advantage that a winning team have compare to the team who's currently loosing. I know it's just a non-competitive mode with no big priority, although it has a huge playerbase.

Alec

We have a fix for this coming next week actually. You'll get two random perks (one Minor and one Major) each time you spawn.

Conflux
> What's the overall design goals/pillars for perks?
> 
> For some, heroes perks seem to be covering weakness they may have (Pharah's Drift thrusters, or Reaper's Dire Triggers), while other perks seem to allow players more skill expression (Sigma's Massive Impact, or Ana's Biotic bounce), and some perks just seem odd or unfitting for the hero (Sombra's White Hat or Moira's Contamination).
> 
> Is there a set philosophy for perks that can be shared with the community? Because it seems like perks are trying to solve a lot of problems in the sandbox.

Alec

Perks are mainly about creating new things for your heroes to do, increasing situational viability, and giving you more agency over your in-match experience.
 
For that goal of increasing the amount of situations in which a hero can be viable: That can come through via shoring up weaknesses against certain heroes, that can also come through by adding mobility so certain heroes can be played on more maps. That goal led to perks like Junkrat's Frag Cannon, Sigma's Levitation, and many more.
 
For perks like Sombra's White Hat, that is fulfilling a particular hero fantasy that many players wanted us to lean into and we think that's an interesting opportunity the perks system creates. Over time, we'll see how players respond to some of those more off the wall ones.

MetastableToChaos

> Very important question: Will the new heroes since OW2's release be getting dance emotes?

Kenny

I don't know when everyone's Dance emotes are coming in, but I can confirm that Rammattra is up next, and soon (tm).

SonOfGarry 

> Are perks going to start rotating next season or are you going to wait and let the current batch simmer for a bit before changing them?
> 
> Bouncing off of that, if you are looking at specific underperforming/less interesting perks now, which ones are on the potential chopping block (a lot of my friends have noted the extra throw range on Hog/Junk trap as being quite weak)?
> 
> Finally, do you have any desire to ever add another level to perks (either something in between minor and major, or even something above major)?

Kenny

We're going to start rotating in some new perks in Season 16, but before we get there we've got a bunch of balance changes and tweaks coming in the Season 15 midcycle patch, and there are good things coming for some underperforming perks.

Things like: Hog Toss now increasing the damage of Pig Pen, Juno's double jump reset perk is also going to increase the duration of glide boost. On the other end of the spectrum, Bastion's self repair resource meter is coming back.

We did a ton of iteration on how many levels perks should come with. There were versions with 2 levels up through I think 4, and even one where you eventually had all minor and major perks. 3 levels has been the sweet spot for a while, but that's not to say the system can't evolve. Still a bit early, but its a system that can evolve if need be.

ModWilliam

> Was pre-selecting perks / perk presets ever considered?

Kenny

We did discuss the idea of pre-selecting perks and the original design even had an interface for them as a loadout in the hero gallery. But once we started playtesting the abilities themselves, there were a lot of situations where we'd want to go with a different perk based on the situation at hand. Being locked into a choice made prior to really being 100% on what you would want to choose felt like a worse option than always giving yourself options. That's not to say this couldn't change as people get used to the choices and their playstyles with perks become a bit more cemented though.

Cryptographer

> What is a primary weapon archetype you either want to fit in that you haven't yet, or think is at the very least under explored?

Kenny

The one weapon that always comes up during the ""what's next"" discussion is the flame thrower. We'd love to get one in, but it's gotta be epic.

ModWilliam

> Do we have any stats on which perk selections are the most one-sided? E.g. one perk is picked over the other 90% of the time

Scott

We do have stats that show perk selection rates per hero. I would say it's variable depending on the hero and the rank that they're being selected. In general, when a perk has an incredibly high pick rate, it's due to the other option not being enticing.

For example, Roadhog's Minor Hog Toss isn't picked very often compared to Scrap Hook. Other options like Ramattra's Void Surge is a cool perk to play with that increases the heroes damage, so it's much preferred over the simpler defensive option Prolonged Barrier.

Overall, the perk selection rates that are one-sided are the ones you would expect, and we're using these stats and feedback to identify which perks need to be either balanced or changed in future patches.

Brutalrogue99

> Are there any perks that you’ve seen a lot of praise for that you think you could potentially incorporate into the hero’s base kit?

There aren't any current plans to implement specific perks into hero kits, but there are perks that have helped heroes in ways that could lead to changes in the future.

I think the biggest example of this would be Bastion. The perks have helped fill in some of the holes in their kit. For example:

\- Armored Artillery making the ultimate more dynamic

\- Smart Bomb helping Bastion's lack of mobility

\- Self Repair aiding survivability issues (a resource limitation is coming in the midseason patch)

These perks have made the hero both better overall but much more fun to play as well. This was some of the major goals perks were trying to accomplish, but I can see us taking some parts of perks and putting them into base kits as heroes change in the future.

Scott

There are definitely some on the radar that we're keeping an eye on.

Obviously Tracer's Major perk Flashback was one that we were wary of and are looking to see how impactful this perk can be.

Mobility perks like Zarya's Minor Jump-Ups, this gives her a LOT of vertical mobility and is very strong on some maps, but its pick rate varies dramatically depending on the rank.

There is a list of perks that have been underperforming both in win and pick rate that we're actively looking at to make balance changes or even replace them starting in Season 16.

The goal is to make every set of Minor and Major perks feel like there is a choice to be made depending on your playstyle, the map, or how the match is going. If a perk feels like it's always the right choice or the wrong choice, then we want to make changes.

Thank you for your kind and honest question........ !

I personally had the most fun with Craftsman, if you haven't tried chasing your pinning Reinhardt to give him some armor it's a lot of fun!

Other notable mentions would be Pharah's Concussive Implosion or Zarya's Jump Ups

> Howdy! Wanted to ask how the team decides when to strictly buff an ability versus when to give it a drawback. Stuff like Sombra’s lockout duration increasing but decreasing her hack range by 30%, and Mercy’s Flash Heal being tied to Res where using Flash Heal means you can’t Res for 15 seconds, and using Res mean you can’t Flash Heal for 30. But then we see Tracer get all her blinks back on Recall as a massive boost despite no drawback like freezing her Blink CD or increasing her Recall CD. Do you see yourselves introducing drawbacks to more perks, or removing/reducing existing ones to shake up under/over preforming perks?

Scott

When first ideating on perks the team included more perks that had a strong benefit but a drawback. It was found that in some situations it could feel worse to play a perk even if the benefit was strong.

This can be seen currently with Sombra's Major, Stack Overflow. We wanted to give players an option to be able to increase the lockout duration to secure more kills, but reduce the range to make it riskier. We've received a lot of feedback that this perk doesn't feel good to use, or play against, so we're planning on making a balance change to help, and potentially replace it in the future.

We want to avoid situations like these in the future, and in the instance we do have a perk that has a drawback, we want to ensure that the other perk option doesn't also have a drawback so that there's always a beneficial option.

Re1nForce

> I'm curious what the upper limitations are of perks as it relates to hero design and hero identity?
> 
> For example, I think Mercy is a good example of a hero that does not have the same level of skill expression as a Tracer (obviously, just as an example), would there be a world in which Mercy would receive a perk that could potentially elevate Mercy's skill expression in exchange for more impact?
> 
> Additionally, do you view perks as ""seasonal""? In which for example (extreme example) one season of Overwatch Mercy might lean into the damage boost aspect, whereas in future seasons for the purpose of changing things up, Mercy might even get a perk in which she can speed boost teammates instead? I think this could potentially be a pretty dramatic but fun way to change up the game and help some heroes to still be played but not conventionally fitting into certain compositions, but perhaps in your eyes it's a bit extreme for the purpose that Mercy's kit is supposed to serve?

Scott

Hey Jonny!

For the first round of perks we were focused on adding perks that enhance or change the way that you play heroes. In the future we could implement more transformative perks that would add skill expression, or change the style in which you would currently play a hero.

I wouldn't say that perks have ""seasonal"" themes in which they will be designed to play a hero a certain way, but we've learnt a lot about what perks are the most interesting and fun, while also seeing the impact that they can have on a heroes win/play rate.

Zakainu
> Now that perks are in players hands, what is your approach going to be moving forward when it comes to balancing and interating on them? Are you planning on radically changing perks in the future, and are you currently looking at adjusting the perks that are over/underperforming when it comes to pick rates?
> 
> In regards to Stadium, I'm very excited to try it. Can you shed some light on the regularity with which we can expect to see heroes added to Stadium? I would love to see what crazy upgrades you guys have in mind for Wrecking Ball.

Scott

For now the primary goal is to focus on adjusting the perks that are underperforming/overperforming. We will have a balance pass coming through in the Season 15 Midseason patch, and will be swapping out some perks that haven't been performing well in Season 16.

Pick and win rates are important factors in deciding what needs to be changed, but there is also a lot of great feedback we've received about perks that don't feel good to use or play against.

I wouldn't say there are radical changes to perks in the near future, but we will be working to ensure perks feel good to use for all heroes.

Bass-Slut

> Will changing perks mid game ever be an option?

Scott

We want it to feel like you're making a meaningful choice when you select your perk, and when allies/enemies select their perk you understand what to expect on that hero for the match.

We understand that there is an issue with people accidentally selecting a perk and being unable to change it, this is something we're keeping an eye on to see if there's something that can be done to help this.

I won't say that it will never be an option to swap your heroes perks in the future, but there are currently no plans to add changing perks mid game."

Why perk system is wrong on a philosophical level despite being able to save OW2 pt.2,Competitiveoverwatch,0,1izl7ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1izl7ht/why_perk_system_is_wrong_on_a_philosophical_level/,48,2025-02-27 18:25:49,"Hi, same guy here. This is the link to part 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1ivqf5t/why\_perk\_system\_is\_wrong\_on\_a\_philosophical\_level/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1ivqf5t/why_perk_system_is_wrong_on_a_philosophical_level/)

To sum up my points in the previous post, perk system bloats characters' kits, and some perks mess up the uptime-downtime balance.

Here in this second post, I am going to further explain why perk system is bad through the lens of hero fantasies, including lore-leaning fantasies and in-game fantasies. Yes, perks, at least some, are dangerous to hero fantasies.

Let's talk about lore-leaning fantasies first. This word does not really exist, so here is my operational definition of this word: Lore-leaning fantaies mean characters creating an overall vibe for players by doing things that make sense in the context of the story. 

For example, the fantasy of Reinhardt is established when he swings the hammer because he is supposed to be able to swing his hammer based on his backstory, the fantasy of Moira is established when she gains hp by doing dmg because she is the evil scientist who can rebuild humanbody through chemicals, the fantasy of Cassidy is established when players hit 2 headshots and delete a player because he is a sharpshooter lore-wise.

The way some perks mess with it is by giving characters features outside of their story, personality, and character. One of the examples is Hanzo's Sonic Disruption, the one that allows Hanzo to **\*HACK\*** health packs. Story-wise, Hanzo has never been a hacker. He has been a martial art(sword&bow) master ever since the existence of the character. Personality-wise, he even has a voiceline with Cassidy on how both of them only use retro weapons. It makes no sense to make Hanzo capable of hacking things. It goes directly against both his backstory and his character. 

Another example is Tracer's blink packs, the one that gives her blink charge upon taking health packs. Tracer's blinks has never had anything to do with getting healed or anything related to it. Her blinks are the results of Winston's stablizer and Tracer her own time-related superpower. There is no in-story explanation for blink packs to exist."

The discussions about perks and S15 really shows how much bad faith there is in overwatch internet discourse,Competitiveoverwatch,440,1izg7eg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1izg7eg/the_discussions_about_perks_and_s15_really_shows/,124,2025-02-27 14:49:16,"I've seen so many articles, Reddit posts and comments, YouTube thumbnails... which basically boil down to ""Oh wow overwatch 2 is finally a fun and good game ?"" That discourse stems directly from the introduction of perks and the added depth and fun factor they provide. 

But while I agree they are a great addition, they're not THAT much of a game changer. Sojourn having 15 more bullets in her gun, or even tracer regenerating blinks on recall, are not what makes overwatch as a whole a great game.

This feels way more like perks are being used, deliberately or not, by a lot of people to try the game again with a somewhat open mind instead of being actively looking for the next thing to complain about and karmafarm.

But it's such a shame honestly. All these guys saying they are having a lot of fun with the game now probably would have been doing the exact same before, it's the same crisp gameplay that's been here since 2016. But people were just willing to ignore all that good stuff simply for the sake of  internet circlejerk."

Ranked reset,Competitiveoverwatch,32,1izbm35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1izbm35/ranked_reset/,38,2025-02-27 10:05:56,"Dear Diary,

Anyone else feel like ranked resets are pretty annoying or just me? 

Just to share my experience, I slogged through lopsided matches, throwers and leavers of diamond last season to return to my former peak ie masters 4 just one tricking tracer.

So there I was in m4 enjoying some of the tastiest games of all time. Everyone basically understood the macro fundamentals of overwatch and the game began to settle down into more predictability and consistency from its former chaos in diamond. 

I was so hyped to play in a masters 4 - masters 2 lobby last season. For reference, I play in Korea. If you check the leaderboards for last season, you’ll see that this lobby is basically entirely top 500 if not very close to top 500. I’m masters 4 70% pushing my peak about to break masters 3, playing against the best players I’ve ever faced. And holding my own! Going 15-3 while the rest of my team has 7/8 kills max (I know stats don’t matter but I’m trying to convey that I was proud that I was performing decently against people I thought would stomp me). 

Then boom ranked reset. Not even a hard reset, it’s a soft reset that basically just demoted you 5 ranks. Like all this champ streamers now in gm, and me and many players I had met playing in masters lobbies last season now seen in diamond 4. 

Which would be fine if d4 just felt like the new m4. I only care about my progression. But the problem is there are these new players or returning players that are really awful. Like I swear and I beg you to bear with me. I’m not a teammate hater. I hate blaming my teammates. But guys these are like actual negative stats teammates or more than 1 death per minute. 

I swear to god I’m not tripping 😭😭 idk what is going on but there are some games where I can go I’m not even kidding 24-1 and my teammate is 8-13 and we lose. And these aren’t one off scenarios. This is like every game. When they’re on the enemy team, I win with utter and complete ease, and when they’re on my team, I just lose. It’s really one sided and you just end up with super big win streaks when you don’t get these teammates and super big loss streaks when you do. 

I swear this is not cope. I couldn’t have forgotten how to play at a masters level in 1 week. I don’t want to have to slog again overwatch please lord I just want to push my peak. Stop throwing me back into the gulag. It’s not effective to learn the game when you aren’t pushing your level and feels so pointless and discouraging when you play the best game of your life but “rein hold shield for me” teammate is going 6-14. 

Edit to add: the posts feels pretty salty and teammate blamey but I don’t know how else to phrase this. I’m not trying to blame teammates. Like I said, I get these players on enemy teams too and they help me win as much as they help me lose. I’m just trying to say that these players clearly don’t belong at this rank. Love to my teammates and I wish the torb that went 7-11 nothing but the best in life. I hope they become rich famous hot and hyper successful with a loving wife/husband, a beautiful home, 3 huskies 4 golden retrievers and 3 amazing kids."
"A Guide to Archiving Overwatch Content on Twitch Before April 19th, 2025",Competitiveoverwatch,121,1iza4vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1iza4vt/a_guide_to_archiving_overwatch_content_on_twitch/,1,2025-02-27 08:14:05,"Hey /r/COW!

*this post is for educational purposes only*

This post was prompted by the recent [call to action](https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1ivyjls/psa_early_ow1_ogn_apex_history_is_about_to_be/) by /u/EsportToys where they brought to the community's attention the changes to Twitch's terms of service that delete thousands of hours of archived Overwatch content from the past 9 years. This includes channels like OGNEsports (Overwatch APEX) and other tournaments that have not been replicated anywhere else. Since that post was made, I have been slowly archiving the Overwatch Apex streams from the OGNEsports and FACEIT_Overwatch and I would like to share my methods so that others might join in and help preserve this era of Overwatch history.

#Step 1

First thing's first, you'll need to find a channel on Twitch that you would like to archive. That might be a smaller tournament channel like BPL or a larger one like FACEIT_Overwatch.

#Step 2

Alright, you have a channel you want to archive, but you will need a client to download their broadcasts. I would highly recommend [TwitchDownloader](https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader/releases), which has a very nice GUI for Windows users. This tool allows you to download entire VODs, portions of VODs, as well as the entire Twitch chat logs for each of those broadcasts or highlights. 

#Step 3

You have the tool to download VODs, but if you would like to move beyond manually copying and pasting video links into TwitchDownloader, I have a [little script](https://pastebin.com/raw/ycQa2m9y) that will extract all video links from a specified Twitch channel (past broadcasts or highlights, check the code comments). It does require you to create an 'Application' in the [Twitch developer portal](https://dev.twitch.tv/console) by following these steps:

1. Click on Applications in the left sidebar after you've logged in
2. Click on 'Register Your Application'
3. Give the application a unique name, so you might have to be a little creative here. Enter http://localhost/ as the OAuth Redirect URL, it doesn't really matter what you put in there but I found that to work for this. Select any category, I chose Other.
4. Click 'Create'. 
5. On the next page, click on Manage next to your new application. At the bottom of that screen you will see your Client ID and your Client Secret. You might have to create a new one if you don't see one there. As the name might imply, don't share these with anyone else.
6. Copy the contents of [this page](https://pastebin.com/raw/1BJiyEFj) and paste them into Notepad. Replace the your-client-id and your-client-secret with these numbers, and replace the user login with the channel name you would like to archive. Save this file as something like 'twitch.py' to somewhere like your Downloads folder.
9. Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed, and then run the following commands after opening your Command Prompt.
    cd Downloads (or wherever you saved the .py file)
    python twitch.py

This should save a list of all of the past broadcasts for that channel that are available. If you would like to switch to highlights instead of past broadcasts change the ""archive"" on line 31 to ""highlight"".

#Step 4
Copy these links and paste them into Twitch Downloader by going to the Task Queue tab and clicking URL list. It will prompt you for things like whether you would like to download the VOD, the chat, and whether you would like to render the chat as a video. You can mess around with the settings for that in the Chat Render tab.

---

That's really all there is to it. It should download the VODs in their source quality for your archiving pleasure. The more people that we can have locally storing these pieces of Overwatch history the better!

Sombra Perk Rework Ideas,Competitiveoverwatch,42,1ixqfho,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1ixqfho/sombra_perk_rework_ideas/,31,2025-02-25 09:40:21,"IMO, all four of her works need a lot of work:


The problem with her minor perks is just heavy undertuning. Compared to some other heroes having extremely powerful minors (Ram, Haz, Ana, Bap, Pharah) or just large buffs to their gameplans (tracer & ball health pack perks for ex.), she has two extremely situational things which are horrifically undertuned.

**Viral Efficiency** 

If you've landed a kill with your Virus, it is extremely rare that you'll actually have the other resources (HP, ammo, etc) to gain any advantage from having the perk. Sombra is an assassin so the enemy you're killing is either isolated, or you're going to have to get the fuck out of dodge the moment you finish the kill unless you want to get traded for it. So mostly the perk only ends up making a difference during cleanup of fights you've already won.

Possible Improvements:

1. Killing a target who has been hit by virus takes X seconds off of every cooldown. Less damage oriented and more uptime oriented. Having your TL come up faster because you've killed someone can meaningfully help you avoid getting traded after a kill and set up for the next hit much faster. 
2. Killing a target who has been hit by virus takes X seconds off of Virus's cooldown and refills Y Ammo. Keeps the current idea but replenishes one more resource so she has a better chance of actually being able to keep fighting.


**Ctrl Alt Escape**

This one is just horribly undertuned. You generally don't want to be leaving at critical health because it means that catching a stray bullet on your way out is going to kill you. It is also just a pathetically weak effect. Even when you get it, it is passive health regen. It still takes you like 4-5 seconds to be able to fight again from critical.

Possible Improvements:

1. Regenerate 100 HP in 2 seconds after using TL. Much more flexible in potential uses, much more powerful overall. If they want the niche to be resetting to fight again, this one would work.
2. Increase velocity of the TL projectile. Quite simply allow her to get further away from her enemies when she throws it. Even a moderate increase would do a lot towards helping her get out of threat area, and it is flexible because it can also be used for initiation sometimes.
3. Overhealth on TL, instantly decays when you unstealth. If they want this to be a purely dedicated escape option, giving her overhealth the moment she throws the TL until she comes out of cloak would make it much harder to chase her down and kill her. I don't like it because it isn't very flexible but it would achieve that goal.

---

The problem with her Majors is more serious. You know what my major perk choice is for Sombra? I don't skill, and I put up with the flashing shit in my HUD for the rest of the game. 

In general, she needs one perk which does not have a downside or major mechanical change, to avoid situations where you just don't play with a major perk.

**White Hat:**

This thing has two major problems: it is undertuned, and it actively loses you fights by sabotaging your gameplay when it decides that your support strafing into your crosshair while flailing around is more important than interupting that death blossom anyway.

IMO: This thing needs a higher power level to start with, but it also needs them to either A) commit to only being able to hack allies once you've taken the perk, or B) do serious UX work. Ally hack would need to have a substantially higher power level in order to make up for losing one of her main abilities.

Possible Ideas for Ally only hack:

1. Hacks enemies who deal more than X damage to teammates under the effect of White Hat. One problem with the ability is that, a lot of the time, it is better to just hack and kill the person attacking your support than it is to hack-heal your support. This would fix that dilemma. You hack the support standing in death blossom? They get healed and the reaper gets almost instantly interupted on his next damage tick.
2. Sombra gains Opportunist's damage boost and wallhack on targets within LOS of her White Hat target. Essentially, the LOS of the person you Whitehat gives AOE hack without the silencing aspect. You could either hack your supports to get damage boost on the divers, or hack your Winston to get damage boost on the dive. 
3. Some other kind of buff for her allies, ex. cooldown reduction, attack speed, etc. I'm personally not a fan of this since it will turn her gameplay into ally-hack-go-brrrr but some kind of power increase is definitely needed if you take away hacking enemies.

Possible ideas for keeping both hacks:

1. Give the option of setting different keybinds for ally and enemy hack in hero specific settings.
2. Include an option to toggle between hack target types with a button in hero specific settings. 
3. Give more granular options on hack targetting in hero specific settings. Straight up give us priority sliders for distance vs angle so we can tune it exactly as we want it. Let us also set a relative priority on teammates and enemies. 

**Stack Overflow: Delete this.**

In its current form, Overflow is just a bad pick 80% of the time because it forces Sombra too close to enemies. 

However, if they buff it to be more effective, it will become completely obnoxious. Nobody enjoys playing against long hack duration Sombra. Long duration hack should be for EMP only. *Sombra straight up should not have any perks which make hack longer.*

Possible full replacements of this perk:

1. Double Translocator: When throwing translocator, Sombra drops a second one before teleporting. She can press the key again to return to her original position within 4 seconds. Cooldown mechanics work identically to Kiriko's double-TP. 
2. Precision assassin: Opportunist no longer grants a 20% damage increase, but instead grants Sombra a 2.5X headshot multiplier on hacked targets. This is of course still reduced by Tank passive, but it would make Lip OP again. 
3. Dramatic Entrance: Translocator cooldown is increases substantially, but Sombra now refunds ammo and releases a mini-EMP when uncloaking. Mini-EMP has 1/3rd the normal radius (that's like 8x less area, I think?) and only hacks for the normal duration. 

Anyway, the exact ideas here aren't exactly the point so much as that Sombra is the only hero in the game where I just don't skill a major perk and have to listen to the fucking annoying ping. So, blizzard, here is one final idea if you can't figure sombra out:

**Super Effective Instant Sombra Fix:**

1. Add a button to 'skip level up' which removes the notification sound and flashing HUD element for a perk choice. Can still press alt to pick if you chose, just makes it stop notifying you.

----

Overall, I think I'd like to see (1) reducing all CDs on virus kill, (2) higher translocator velocity/range, (3) ally only white-hat which hacks enemies that damage your teammate, and (4) double translocator. I think this would make her interesting, offer up new playstyles, and avoid buffing hack duration or giving her infinite stealth. The translocator major would give her a choice which doesn't actively detract in any way, as you could just not press the button again and suffer no consequence, while White Hat would be a major playstyle change."

This is just a little discussion and personal rant I'm currently D3 for anyone wondering

Personally think soldier would be way cooler with a lower dmg helix and higher base gun dmg cause alot of kills or openings end up being made my helix 

Also I think his sprint should by default be a lil faster like the perk also on the topics of Perks there is no reason for stim to anti you it makes it so much worse than the sprint perk even still I think the sprint is better the reloading while running is also really nice

On the topic of s9 I'm still team bring the bullet size down for all hitscan again and bring some more range to the hero so tired of tickling at a distance that I should be playing at to avoid getting walked down by every opponent side note bring cass bullet back down and give him his range back "
Mobility creep/sustain creep ruins the fun of OW,Competitiveoverwatch,0,1iws9f0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1iws9f0/mobility_creepsustain_creep_ruins_the_fun_of_ow/,49,2025-02-24 04:11:43,"Projectile heroes are the losers in this regard, compared to hitscans. The game has gotten too fast with way too few heroes able to counter the mobility creep. Far too many heroes with free out of jail card abilities these days also, especially newly released heroes. In general it also feels easier to commit mistakes in todays OW compared to before and not getting punished for them, especially the raid boss tanks and certain support heroes. All this is instantly noticeble, going from OW Classic and to the live game

Meanwhile we also have abilities and ultimates that's supposed to stop mobile heroes, like hazard ult, but they are usually the ones that escape it the best and the heroes with low mobility suffer from it.

While perks are fun, they still havent fixed the core issues of 5vs5 and all the the other things theyve introduced problems with in OW2. More powercreep wont resolve anything"
Why perk system is wrong on a philosophical level despite being able to save OW2 pt.1,Competitiveoverwatch,0,1ivqf5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1ivqf5t/why_perk_system_is_wrong_on_a_philosophical_level/,62,2025-02-22 20:09:35,"Perk system is directly bloating every character's kit, and it is not a good thing. ""If everything is broken, nothing is broken"" is not a statement that makes sense in games, especially competitive ones like Overwatch 2. Characters' power levels are designed around and tied to other in-game elements like maps, structures, and the overall style of the game. Mobility creep is such a problem for most people is because of this. High grounds that are designed to be hard to access become easier and easier to access with every new hero with vertical mobility released: LW, Illari, Juno, Venture, Hazard, and the upcoming Freja. When all ten players in a match can have easy access to high ground, what is the meaning of high ground anymore? Sure, high ground is still going to be different from flat ground, but its tactical value is not going to be the same as before.

Perk system is doing exactly that. Most of the perks are nothing game-changing but straight buffs meaning to bloat the game. I've devided thes perks into tw categories. 

The first one is ""increasing uptime."" This type of perks includes ashe getting bullets for hitting shots, rein getting shield for firestrike, lucio getting bullets for wall slide, soldier getting bullets for landing rockets, Orisa decreasing weapon temperature on headshots, tracer getting more blinks etc. This is very problematic for our current game because of how it messes with heroes' downtime. One of the biggest complaint of Hazard two months ago was that his uptime was too long with the block-wall-jump away-jump in cycle. Ashe needing to reload(downtime) after dishing out 12 long range burst dmg is an important part of her balancing and character identity. How many ashe have the experience of missing the last shot, not getting the kill, and losing the team fight because that guy got full and ulted? This is how ashe gets punished for missing shots or wasting bullets earlier. Giving ashe more bullets is directly undermining this part of her identity and all the intricacy around it. The same goes for all the other heroes. Hog getting punished for forgetting to reload, soldier running out of bullets, rein hiding behind walls, tracer dying after recalling with no blinks, etc are all important aspects for these individual heroes and the game as a whole. ""If everything is broken, nothing is broken"" does not work because there are beauties in weakness and inconvenience. Downtime-uptime is important in OW, and the perks mentioned above are not healthy for the game because they tilt the balance between downtime and uptime.

People do not normally think about the concept of downtime and uptime when they're gaming, so I won't blame you if you can't see the problem presented. Here is an analogy with valorant that can help further explain the situation.

In valorant, rounds are clearly split into pre-plant and post-plant. Every agent has a limited amount of abilities, with only a few abilities rechargable by time or by kills. What happens in most rounds is that most of the abilities will be used pre-plant for entry, and post-plant will have a lot less abilties. Only special comps like deadlockvyse comps that specifically plays for post-plant can have most of their abiltiies saved for post-plant. Characters like Breach got nerfed because they had too much abilities that can be saved to post-plant. Now, imagine every agent gets twice of their original abilities. You can tell things will be very very wrong even if you don't play valorant. The way people approach pre-plant, the way post-plant plays out, comps that specialize in post-plant, saving abilities, tradeoff in saving abilities or using them for entry, etc all will be different. Most valorant players don't think about it, just like how most players don't think about downtime-uptime, but nuances like these matter a lot to games. They are directly tied to the identity of the game even if they are not presented to people on a surface level. Changing them is to change the identity of the game, and to what degree would people realize the game they loved is no longer the game they love?"
"Reacting to OW2 Spotlight (Perks, Freja, Stadium) - Plat Chat Overwatch Ep 254 ft. Rakattack",Competitiveoverwatch,108,1irs1vi,https://www.youtube.com/live/vMJbkh0qh2A?si=hncIKMgBikuTif0X,27,2025-02-17 20:14:31,
Perks look like they have the chance to hit on so many cylinders,Competitiveoverwatch,52,1iolidm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1iolidm/perks_look_like_they_have_the_chance_to_hit_on_so/,12,2025-02-13 16:26:04,"From a content perspective there’s so much new that comes with this, and in my opinion this looks like the exciting/big change people wanted to see when you slap a 2 next to a hit game. On release ow2 felt more like a reconfiguration of a known classic, trying to cut down on some features that introduced difficult problems instead of adding more bulk to the game and building on itself.

We obviously haven’t been able to test out perks yet, but part of what made overwatch feel so special were the abilities and the fantasies behind them and im excited to see them lean into that direction more through this new mechanic.

I feel like we’ve all had moments where we’ve fantasized about exciting/wacky/creative mechanics being added to certain heros, and though some fantasies may never come true, the devs have clearly shown their willingness for bolder ideas like sticky torb turrets or flying zenyatta. Adding abilities that are fun for the sake of fun feels like such a reward to fans who want to see certain heros unlock their true potential, like letting illari go super sayin blue or orisa dropping like a rock while entering fortify mid air and squishing those around her. They probably do that stuff in the in game universe! And it’s just really neat to see it iterated on through gameplay. Maybe theyll add level 5 perks one day where doomfist can actually punch buildings off the map just like in cannon

Besides the fantasy aspect i think perks, especially minor ones, will provide a helpful nudge to players who might need only a couple tweaks to improve their performance/in game experience. In addition i think it could allow the devs to rotate in and out new hero mechanics easier, providing another avenue of new content while letting characters maintain a core kit/identity. Now when having discussions on reworking characters, we might find the solution is slapping on a new perk option instead of needing to uproot so much of their original identity which imo sounds a lot better than questioning which parts of kits should go in the trash."
Gavin with Emongg,Competitiveoverwatch,74,1io4hk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1io4hk1/gavin_with_emongg/,36,2025-02-13 00:01:43,"Should win rates be visible? Potentially.

Gameplay engineers have been working on Stadium for years. 

FOV on Console. Some tech difficulty. Not that they don't want to do it, but it's just difficult. PC game has to have FOV sliders ""duh"" 

Total Mayhem and Mystery Heroes may/likely not have Perks

Smurf changes going well. Play againsts bot first few times, so instantly gauge how well someone does. 

Some people sell (?) bots and so cheaters trial matches and ALWAYS lose those matches... But that makes it very obvious when cheaters are always losing to bots and doing no damage. 

Gavin Was/is working on Rank Portraits update.

Charms are in s15 patch but don't display till s16

April Fools _will_ be funnyyyy. 

Gothenburg map. Originally 2CP. It's cursed. No work is being done one it. Unlucky history. 

Clash. There is a plan. But it could be another Assault (2CP). And if Clash doesn't work, they WILL cut it and just give up on it, but they hope they don't have to cut it. 

One of the maps in Stadium is inside the arena seen from Colloseo

Stadium: Mercy Rule (auto win) when team goes 3-0 (like white-wash I believe?). Takes away from the 3-4 reverse sweep, but don't want to sour the experience due to how unlikely it is. (like playing vs 4 stack) 

They want to add health bar UI but it took too much space so theyre thinking about it. But a lot of time went into Stadium UI, like every perk has unique design. 

Maps are specific to Stadium. So even if KOTH round instead of adding to Control

Making Progression system more front and center. But not a priority but in the pipeline.

Map voting. No commitment to specifics. 3 maps to vote from. Role a die, 1 in 10 chance an unlikely role may happen. There is a chance Kings Row can be played 3 times in a row.

The way it works is 2 of 3 maps are least maps played but 3rd is completely random. But of course, it's chosen from the pool of all 10 players, so quite random.

Other players highlight is cool (Rivals) but they're working on cooler features. 

Rehaul of Top 500. Gavin personally wants to do. But resources. Cooler things takes predecence, but top 500 is too niche to focus on. 

Gavin talked wacky idea to management and stuff about something he didn't elaborate on (lol). Dangerous from a social perspective, not a design one. 

Target bans. Dangerous at streamer level if someone joins stream and notice Emongg is also on Ilios... 

Banned Heroes are banned for everyone. Just for clarity. 

Gavin mentions ""they"" have a cool game (Rivals)

Chat says competition is good for consumer.

Gavin is Role queue stan. Gavin wasn't supposed to play employee beta as he didn't work there yet lmao.
Rivals is open queue so he doesn't like Rivals, but Gavin says they have some really cool characters.

Gavin's peak Masters. Only played group = throw games (by design, wants it to happen, doesn't enjoy playing alone) so answer is Plat to Diamond. ""Gold+ is high rank, of course"".

Gavin+Emongg: Playing with friends is underrated and enjoyable.

Surrender option as a 5 stack could be added. But only building for niche audience... is not happening. Good enough option to add it when someone wants to surrender but their team then actually wins and it feels rewarding. 

#Moira rework failed. Reaper may still be considered but isn't actively being looked at.

Map votes aren't about modes essentially, just to give more options. 

3rd to 1st pov. May open a new playstyle. 

MMR reset. Never. Slightly harder than last soft reset. 

Emongg: 3rd person feels good. Only wants to keep playing it to get a feel. 

Map voting is comp only. 

Could be following a DPS, Support, Tank order... But too early to tell. 

Stadium will only be comp (not fully sure if I heard that right) 

Gavin likes cereal and yogurt, parfaits. Cinnamon roll hot or miss 

Favorite heroes to Bans might be added. 

Share or recommend builds? Not considered yet. 

Gavin didn't comment when Emongg answered about flamethrower (considering it's probably the most demanded hero type to the game for years. Then again they did fail to add it with Mauga and Ball) 

CoD Zombies... (Zomnics for rating appropriate.) A lot of people in the team likes it but no plans right now. 

Gavin likes Mauga due to Heavy in TF2. He's part of the problem. They Mauga criticisms are valid. 

Stadium first, possibly could expand into Roguelite. But it's taking a long time. Having to flesh out eat Hero first. 

Wanted to make cosmic weapon skins without making it distracting like the movement of the stars with the new Galactic Weapons 

Colorblind players can't see versus Gold and Jade. But it is what it is. It's not just color this time, but more to it. 

6v6 is limited time... Gavin makes no such decision. But it's a test to see if it draws an audience. Cuz criticism was it wasn't taken seriously due to no competitive mode, so if people truly want to play the game more with 6v6, then that may be the way to work on it. 

Stadium won't be as sweaty as current comp. 

Don't know if collabs skins in Lootboxes

Stadium was worked on at least a year, for sure. 

Plan is to add more Heroes to Stadium upon launch. 

Destiny Gambit/PvPvE isn't the direction for Stadium

Workshop... Maybe keep requesting it. 

If Gavin would instantly add a feature... World Peace x Overwatch

Gavin did scoreboard, ping system, comp... He's a spectator to this stuff, But Stadium changes took years. 

Clash didn't fail. Hard problem was what to do with the final point. If too easy, too short OR too hard, then no point to cap.... Could just change point entirely. Maybe change to Round mode like beating map is just one point but that leads to variable game time. 

But it's really variable on when to attack A/E, how many times to keep attacking, and it's all just very unintuitive... Problem with TF2 back cap was, what Jeff said is, they try not to give multiple objectives at same times as team can disagree on what to do when they can't even agree on the win condition, so giving 2 win conditions is a really scary thing to add, making the team really frustrating. 

TF2 had bigger team sizes so it worked for TF2... Clash just has difficult game design problems. 

Unlikely for 2CP to come back. 

If no one wants to vote for maps, then maybe they don't need to be in the pool in the first place? (big picture questions) 

2CP maybe fixable? But too hard due to chokes

Gavin didn't want to do hero Bans due to toxicity between team mates. But he may be too focused on the bad than the good. ""Should you chase something that could fail?"" 

Before Rivals even came out, they were talking about Bans due to OWCS. 

Gavin's dream game mode: not sure how often he wants to add new game modes. Stadium is a meta-mode. Not aware of Paris being a full Push map. 

Gavin Fav: Escort or Flashpoint. The classic vs strategic. 

Hope to make improved maps, like for Push and Flashpoint. 

No idea why Juno and Hazard don't have Steam achievements. 

Gavin really wants to add Advanced Hero Info. But surprisingly taking a lot of time. As Heroes are setup in scripts. But they don't want to keep having to update script for every change. So Gavin is taking game data from script and linking it to the UI. Engineers are doing that. But it's like making a thread between script and UI. Need to show many things, but need to show a lot of system information (one to one), so it's not easy. 

Jetpack cat and animal heroes. Nothing to say about that. 

Gavin likes Mama Hong. Funny character. 

Gavin is aware of r/EmreMains and that there's a streamer mode named after him. This was Miranda's joke. 👀

MacaroniGlove streamer mode name - Moira Mythic 

Mauga was in dev before Gavin joined. 

Gavin does not know why flamethrower failed for Ball and Mauga. 

Gavin likes to play everything. Most played is Ana.  Fav design is Ramattra. 

Gunblade: Illari wasn't made from a gunblade design perspective but just to look cool. But Gavin understands why players may want that fantasy considering she does have a gunblade.

Venture wasn't a solution to Doom Tank. It opened up a hero focused on abilities. Alex made Venture.

Pyra (? Not sure of spelling) made Illari (hero design concept and abilities, for Venture and Illari)

Bot fill in for a leaver. Cursed problem. They could... But too much variability across Ranks, but could be added for Quick Play.

Freja is a projectile Hero. Both primary and secondary.

Gavin knows nothing about Spotlight being an alternate to Blizzcon.

No alien Heroes as the story is futuristic but about humans

Rank is not MMR.... If Rank was MMR and someone was Bronze, it would be really bad for Overwatch. As since it's not, one can level up faster. This is to reduce fakeness of matches.

Hero trials: Win rates by rank, region, platforms... Then look at damage and death at each rank. LW had one of the lowest death rates but also one of the lowest win rates, but his up time wasn't changing the outcome... And they learned a lot from Lifeweaver. And that is why we have Hero Trials.

Rank inflation: up when not normally go up, and have to decide if that is wanted to be in system.

No plan to add rank below Bronze. Because it isn't a good feeling.

Master, GM, Champion will more people pushed in it. But Gavin isn't convinced as many people will be in Champion. But queue time issues, particularly Champion one. 

Bronze could get more divisions. But they want to make B4 and B5 a smaller part of the pool

Arcade as one pool is a cool idea, but that is not easy to do and would take a long time.

Revealing player count of Arcade in dead mode could be interesting... But no mode is dead, but some modes may be less populated at certain times.

Server selector? Gavin isn't against it. But not his expertise. Giving player choice can lead to them making a bad decision. It's not an easy feature. Need to put in warnings.

Quick Play MMR doesn't reset with Rank reset.

Heroes with 2 forms are the hardest like Cloak/Dagger, DVa, Ram... They aren't against it. C/D are actually 2 different characters, but Gavin says that is what Ram is that same concept.

Gavin _would like an Overwatch show_ too (working in game dev: Working in submarine should be same as spaceship cuz you can't breathe outside anyways)

Invasion event: people liked the lore, but the gameplay was questionable. Gavin didn't worked on PvE so can't say much.

April Fools 2025 has real effort into it. Really dumb.

Cannot swap Perks. But 3rd round in comp may allow it. 

Gavin says Post Game cards are cool, but not actively being worked on, didn't get time to rebuild for OW2, but they'd be done differently. 

Quick Play is generally most played. Comp can sometimes surpass it, like during Comp Reset... Arcade rarely unless like Junkenstein Labs

If you cancel long queue and requeue and find a game, it may have been a bug.

Gavin is really interested in bans, for what was shown.

Reworks of Survasa and NJC

3rd person peaking... Is a question for Stadium designers

More than 3 heroes a year? Prioritizing quality.

Marvel movie Gavin likes: Winter Solider, Iron Man 1, Guardians movies.

Dr Strange portal for Sym is too heavy on the game. And if someone knew they had a tech advantage (somehow), it would be exploited. 

Gavin is a perfectionist. Wishes there were fewer draws in hybrid. Nit pick. 

If team had 3 times as people, could add Hero every season. (joke) 

Can't swap Heroes in Stadium. 

Clash in Stadium could work as a Round based Clash game mode. 

_Jetpack Cat is a Hero_

Juno headshot heals could be, but it makes it awkward for DVa or Winston. 

No plans for Announcer Packs.

Aaron Keller on Emongg's stream,Competitiveoverwatch,418,1io1505,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1io1505/aaron_keller_on_emonggs_stream/,69,2025-02-12 21:40:07,"Stadium: Hoping for 3rd Pillar of Overwatch  with a full team around it, with updates, revolving, and evolving features over time. 

Bans hope to control ones gameplay. 

He talks that Bans were tested 2 years ago, but now that they see it happen (Rivals probably) that they had to added it now

Hints that maybe updated Workshop one day (huge huge vague maybe), planned since Jeff days with full Editor. But it's hard to give everything. It's a resource game at the end of the day. 

Bans are for all Ranks.

Can hint what hero each player wants to play to avoid having your hero banned, but any Hero can be banned regardless. 

Everyone gives 3 weighted choices, with priority on first.  Up to 4 per game, 2 per role max. 

Can 3rd person come to the whole game? Dangerous question. Easiest answer is to see Stadium reception. References Rivals, but says different game. Ow is aim focused while Rivals is ability and melee focused. 

Stadium is ability focused, hence 3rd person made sense. 3rd person was needed (references Zarya bubbles). 76 needs 3rd person to effectively know what's happening. Genji can be in the air effectively the entire time in Stadium. 

Core should be 1st,but are there options and opportunities to expand? Winston Primal or Lucio Wallriding could be considered in 3rd person. 

Could be a new 3rd person queue, but apprehensive idea. 

Aaron is interested in seeing what kind of playstyle and people arise from the 1st and 3rd shift to min max the game. 

Game is open to perhaps being more risky now. 

Aqua is a Support. ""One of the coolest Primary Fires ever made""

Cinematics: they want to get back to narrative and story. Big set back on how they wanted to tell story. So they had to refocus on how to do it. Nothing to announce, but hoping one day they can move the world state again, after PvE didn't turn out as played. 

Players want devs to take risks and innovation with crazy stuff. PvE was a crazy risk, but it didn't work out. Promises failed. But hope risks will be appreciated and payoff, but things can go wrong but such challenges are inevitable. 

Archives: Completionists want it back, but no answer when and if it'll be back. All new code and everything broke Archives, so it has to be remade, so it's not necessarily worth making all over again. 

Aaron is already a chad for mentioning PvE and Rivals lmao. (self insert) 

Already planning for the S15/refresh for 2026 now.

S9 was great as it did something fundamentally different for the game. Clear goal to do it every year. S9 didn't feel big enough to Aaron, so they want to keep continue big changes. 

TV show: Aaron wants one too, he's a fan it too. But time and cost... So Aaron doesn't decide such stuff. 

Aaron: Jeff was a pro being a director, and he's awesome, charismatic... Aaron being in video is cringe. But have to get used to it. 

Aaron doesn't know if he'll sit in front of a xmas fireplace. But Aaron prefers to build a holiday stream where he builds a map like Atlantis. Could do it every year. 

OW engine is custom crafted for Overwatch and changes are difficult, even 6v6 back. 

Aaron: No FOV slider in game. First instinct was to be no FOV slider.

They'd like to add the bottom left health stuff

If Aaron could magic wand something in the game: Hero Bans a month a go... Weapon Variants, but every hero is so distinct so doesn't want to totally reanimate heroes, but to find ways to work with Heroes by keeping their identity but change what they can do without require major changes, like can't ever change 76 having an Assault Rifle, but having a different gun would be quite apparent

Perks may not be as clear from a spectator perspective, detail wise. 

Weapon inspects: launched OW2 without it. People weren't excited about a lot of new cosmetics so they had to prioritize, but they might get to it as there was pushback.

Looltboxes: S15 feature. Why? Game felt like people who don't spend makes the game less rewarding for them, even tho it's better with coins in BP, but it lacks that small reward for recognizing people play the game. They cannot be bought, and they'll exist in the BP, weekly play X amount of matches, or play events.

Has ton of shop content of OW2. Stuff that isn't purchasable anymore in the shop anymore is going in the Loot Boxes.

Duplicate Protection. So it rerolls the item, that's the hope. No one has all the items yet.

Button to open all Looltboxes, and auto opens all looltboxes at the end of the season.

Giving away a ton of looltboxes in S15. Well over a 100 free lootboxes for playing the game, and also some external sources.

Guild: depriotized after putting some work into it. Also Looking for Group, but it was too niche. Even when looking for other games, it just doesn't work.

Endgame cards: Dev love them internally. Potentially add on, but there's already a lot it stuff end of match UI/UX so they'll have to retool it, but there's a lot of positivity for adding back.

Tournament system: Possibly one day. Internally talk within dev team as to how competitive Overwatch is as a whole at a casual level. But it's a complicated topic, as game is competitive, so does it need more competitive features? Dev team doesn't want the game to be as serious, but if they want to improve competitive feel, could add more.

Junkenstein Lab: Stadium is an evolution. JL helped testing for Stadium. Helped reduce randomness through the shop to add more control and reduce the RNG.

Want another Halloween event, to use new events to test and tease new ways to build and explore Overwatch

Permanent BP: talked about it internally, they do know they exist, but not a priority. Vocal minority asking for it. Maybe they swap to it one day. Put a lot of time into the cosmetics they make. They can't make as many of them to offer as many to satisfy commercial side.

Team has over done themselves when it comes to cosmetics for the next few seasons.

Are open to changing revenue systems maybe next year. This was a tough question Emongg sneaked in

Hero cadence: would be nice if they could improve the frequency of Hero releases.

Emongg clarifies at the end: Love Aaron for answering questions openly and honestly. Straight answers. No PR talk unless active development Aaron can't talk about, so PR talk is technically good, tongue in cheek news. Stadium launches s16.

Emongg clarifies further that Hero bans likely won't be target bans based on player profile, just so someone bans a Mercy OTP for sure. "
Overwatch bugs and QoL changes,Competitiveoverwatch,0,1kd281p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1kd281p/overwatch_bugs_and_qol_changes/,29,2025-05-02 16:23:48,"Have the devs acknowledged anywhere the disappearance of both the leaderboard and your open queue rank in your profile? There's been 4 patches already this season with no fix/mention, and the pinned post about known bugs on the blizzard forums have no mention of it. 

  
And why have there been a bunch of small quality of life changes they're ignored/never addressed? Examples of easy wins they could get are:

\-Putting Kiriko's  TP on cooldawn when spawning so she can't immediately TP back to the fight (just like ball)

  
\-Bringing back the environmental kill icon to bring some flavour back to the game; obviously their enviro kill info has been broken since ow2 came out since they don't give credit when deserved (and reverse) so why not add it back anyways

  
\-Give the ability to unbind the scoreboard interact key. So to save 0.0001 second you can now mute or report people right from the scoreboard at the cost of not being able to melee while looking at the scoreboard; if they're going to make their game worse can they at least let you opt out of it?

  
\-They also randomly changed the way you go through menus yet again; do you have to hold start and then press X to cancel queue now? And why change the way you exit end screens from B to A (except for 1 screen where you have to press B so you can't just spam it)? Who asked for this? Is it just a dev trying to justify being employed?

  
\-This has always been a flaw in the game as far as I know, but why do you keep your hero in mystery heroes if you kill yourself after taking damage? It lets strong characters like pharah, ashe, and sigma keep their characters.  How hard would it be to make it so if someone has taken 50% of their health as damage in the last however many seconds their death counts as being done by an opponent? In a regular game recenetly I got hit by a soldier helix then 5 seconds later jumped off the map to reset and it gave him credit lol, why can that jankiness not be used for good in mystery heroes?

  
\-Why not include the reason someone got banned in your ""thanks for reporting"" message? Rivals let's you know if someone you reported got banned, who they were, and why they got banned. I honestly believe 0 people I've reported have gotten banned for gameplay sabotage (repeatedly sprinting off map, lifeweaver gripping people to try and get off map, etc.) or for ximming/smurfing, the thanks for reporting only seems to come in for bad language lol but it would be nice to confirm I shouldn’t be wasting time reporting people.

  
These are just a few small things they can change about the game to remove pain points, but whether they're things that have existed for 9 years or 9 days they haven't been acknowledged either way which is pretty sad to see. I know they say stadium hasn't taken any dev time away from the main game, but when it took them a year to fix bap's game breaking immortaility bug on console, no real balance updates for months at times (um hello why is ball still busted rn?), and no maps fro the last 4 seasons, it makes a guy wonder if that's really true. Are there any other bugs or quality of life things anyone thinks they should fix?"
"Experience should be consistent, and perks ruined that.",Competitiveoverwatch,0,1kctees,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1kctees/experience_should_be_consistent_and_perks_ruined/,36,2025-05-02 07:29:17,"Generally speaking, some characters have better matchup against some characters and some characters don't. A good genji player is always going to have the upper hand against a good illari player. In a dive scenario, I would say it's at least a 60/40 for the genji player. This dynamic would stay constant for an entire match before introduction of the perk system. 

With the perk system, this dynamic would change in the late stage of a game. Illair's sun burn allows you to apply 70 burning dmg on the enemy who got hit by your outburst, turning it into an ability that deals 95 dmg over a few seconds. 

This completely changes the dynamic between her and genji. Every time I play Illari, I can feel the difference this perk is making. The 40/60 match up for me would almost always turn into a 70/30 after getting this perk. I just shred enemy genji with outburst every time he wants to dive me.

It is infuriating. I do not do anything to earn this perk. Enemy genji do not do anything to deserve getting nerfed mid match. In fact, I can even get the perk earlier by spamming dmg on the enemy tank instead of contesting divers on an off angle.

I don't like how matchups can just change mid match without either side improving/impairing their gameplay. It feels cheap. It feels unrewarding. And it makes the game feel inconsistent. I'd much rather be disadvantaged against genji for the whole game, then just suddenly be able to shred him mid match.

Now, I'm not saying matchups shouldn't be changed. If Blizzard wants to rework Illari into more of a kiri-brig type character instead of a bap-zen character, I would be fine with it, but making this change in the late stage of mid match is unacceptable.

This is how I feel about most of the perks, but especially Illari's, since I main her. Before perks, I could play ow for 10-20 matches on weekends. Now, 5 matches can make me feel exhausted and uncomfortable. I just wish we can get the old vanilla experience back."

I love the game, love the scene, but a basic white and orange namecard with text that says 2025 is just... not cool. It's not exciting. 

You know what is exciting though? Lootboxes. People LOVE lootboxes; it's genuinely been the biggest thing of the announcements today when you look at the gaming community. r/gaming has nothing about stadium, or perks, or hero bans and map voting, but they have a thread celebrating the return of lootboxes. 

If they add lootboxes as a reward to OWCS streams, that would genuinely be the biggest incentive to have people tune in, even more so if it's a reward by time like OWL tokens were instead of just earn them and dip. The chance to get ANY skin instead of just ""baptiste but orange"" would be an insane draw to the casual crowd.

"Could S15's ""groundbreaking"" change be something other than a perk or ban system that achieves similarly goals?",Competitiveoverwatch,122,1imj2v3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1imj2v3/could_s15s_groundbreaking_change_be_something/,71,2025-02-10 23:27:47,"As you know, the devs have announced that there will be groundbreaking changes coming to overwatch for season 15 which has led to speculation over what such a change could be. Many assume this will be a perk system and while I tend to agree, a lot of discussion has happened about bans coming to overwatch. These conversations became even more numerous after rivals launched with a ban system of their own.

However, that's not when those conversations started. [Alec Dawson himself said in an interview in December of 2023 that they were considering a pick and ban system](https://m.twitch.tv/clip/AmusedOutstandingClintMau5-ipeFBqmzODdCB0cX) to adjust the impact swapping has in Overwatch. In this interview, he also mentioned they were testing other features such as a currency system for ""buying"" hero swaps. Recently, Gavin Winter has said their monitoring Rivals ban system and (allegedly might have) said they they aren't currently working on one.

The devs seem to have adopted a philosophy (inspired by a shitton of complaints among the community) that the game should rely less on swapping as the primary way to make adjustments. This along with the pickable passives test and the Junkrnstein LTM have led people to believe that a perk system is being added and will provide players with another way to make adjustments aside from swapping.

Now this could just be blizzard failing to choose their words carefully, but a perk system isnt exactly a new concept. Neither is a ban system. Not what I would consider groundbreaking. However, theres a lot of room in the ""not working on a ban system"" statement for a different system that effectively pulls the game back from a ""swapfest,"" especially without stopping you from picking certain heroes altogether. Even as an off-the-cuff brainstorm idea, a"" currency for swaps"" system would be more innovative than a ban or perk system.

Tldr

Could the ""groundbreaking"" changes coming be (at least partly) a system that achieves the devs goal of lower the potency and necessity of swapping/countering while being more innovative than a just ban or perk system would be?  

Edit My prediction is they've added a currency system and locked both swaps and perks behind it, but I'm sure there are other systems (like user chosen hero pools) that would fit."
How Blizzard can compete with Marvel Rivals hero release schedule.,Competitiveoverwatch,0,1ii3y43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1ii3y43/how_blizzard_can_compete_with_marvel_rivals_hero/,32,2025-02-05 07:31:42,"I've seen a lot of talk about how Overwatch can't compete with how quickly Marvel Rivals is able to create new heroes as the Marvel universe is massive. But they can, the answer has been there since the beginning. 

The answer to more frequent hero releases lies in Heroes of the Storm.

Heroes of the Storm is Blizzard's moba attempt featuring 90 popular characters from Warcraft, StarCraft, Diablo, and Overwatch - with a few characters unique to HotS.

Using characters from all of Blizzard's IP would reduce the time needed to create new characters - allowing them to release new content as quickly as MR does.

Hell if they just based the characters on characters they already have in HotS, they can use a lot of the abilities for inspiration.

I understand that the Overwatch universe has its perks, but I don't see why we can't separate Overwatch the story from Overwatch the game.

I feel like it'd also probably be a pretty big deal and generate more interest in the game."

* when you have the powers comfy cloud(aoe sleep) and dreamy(sleep heals allies) and the perk lethal dose(100 dmg sleeps) it wont proc lethal dose in fact your sleeps no longer do dmg including the base 5 dmg that its supposed to normally do, but that only happens when you combine both powers together, if you have 1 or the other your sleeps Will do dmg including the extra from lethal dose idk why it glitches when you have both
* for sleep regimen from my experience it just straight up doesn't work it WILL give you the base 50+ hp that it gives just for buying it but the other part where ""you apply sleep to an enemy GAIN 10 hp up to 150 hp"" just doesnt work i've tried sleeping multiple enemies b4 buying the power and gained nothing but the normal 50 hp and i've tried buying it b4 ive slept anyone and it gave me no extra hp other than the normal 50 when i sleep people. I have heard some people buy it in a actual game and it give some hp but its never worked for me and it only gave the extra hp for enemies slept b4 buying it and gave no extra hp from sleeping enemies after buying it. I have found though that it does HEAL 10 hp per slept target but that should not be how it works and if that is how its intended then that wouldn't make any sense because how are you supposed to sleep 15 enemies with a SINGULAR sleep dart
* Another one I found is the perk double dosage (sleeping an enemy affected by biotic grenade gives 35% of your sleep cooldown back). I've found it works really weird and for some things it doesn't work the way it should comparatively. 1st it DOES work when you anti an enemy and sleep them including when you sleep multiple enemies with comfy cloud(which is how it should work no complaints there), though the cooldown refund doesn't stack with multiple enemies slept from one sleep but that's probably a good thing. Now here is where it gets weird if you kill them with the sleep it WILL NOT give you the cooldown refund meaning it has negative synergy when you pair it with the lethal dose perk.  another weird thing is that if you add the dreamy power up and hit your allies it thankfully does work but only kind of, you HAVE TO directly hit them with the sleep even when you add the comfy cloud power which IS NOT how it works when you sleep enemies. you DO NOT HAVE TO directly hit enemies that are affected by biotic grenade to get the cooldown refund, but you DO HAVE TO directly hit allies that are affected by biotic grenade to get the cooldown refund. which if you cannot tell makes no sense at all.
* the final one I found is with the power up home remedy(biotic grenade grants over health equal to 100% of its healing) this one is not as crazy as the other points all i found is that the over health is only applied when your allies are yellow(increased healing input) which I don't think that's how it should be, there shouldn't be a duration to the over health especially when you look at how the power up is worded as it does not explicitly state that you can only have the over health while you are currently affected by biotic grenade. I say this because there is a perk called I.V. drip that does explicitly state ""while AFFECTED by biotic grenade ana gains 100 over health"" this makes me really confused as to why they are worded differently even though they work the exact same way. now they probably just worded the power up wrong but personally i hope it's not supposed to work like that and the over health is supposed to be permanent or at least have a longer separate duration(obviously the over health you grant shouldn't be able to stack on top of each other cause that would be to broken)

Im not saying this to dog on the game I just want people to know about this so the devs know to fix it because i havent heard anyone say anything about how ana doesnt work correctly "
Sym is too team reliant for a DPS hero,Competitiveoverwatch,12,1kc9u7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1kc9u7o/sym_is_too_team_reliant_for_a_dps_hero/,61,2025-05-01 16:17:12,"Ive played her for over 1000 hours, been GM/top 500 since OW1

Syms damage sometimes can make her feel like a support at times. She has that weird jack of all trades where she fills the role of a DPS, support and even a tank, (with the ult). Luckily i duo so we play around the Teleporter that has a massive HP of 350 and the range perk, but i really wish she could be more independent, even so in solo Q as she was more before. Too much power into her teleporter in the kit currently.

She has a windup time in her whole kit, thats supposed to be risk = reward, yet it doesnt pay off very well. Her damage numbers could be better, for example her starting beam, level 1, only does 60 DPS, which makes even final blows at low HP targets hard at times. Not even a hero like Winston, Moira or Zarya has that low instant damage

Her orbs deal a max of 100 damage in burst damage, and due to the charge up and travel time, around 90 DPS, can take 3-4 orbs to secure a kill. Many options here to make them feel better, either increase the damage and shrink the proj size of them, or decrease the charge up time

I'm not sure if it's even good, it obviously doesn't help much against heroes that just shoot her to death, but playing against it as someone who has to get close is fucking awful, it already was frustrating before not it's complete ass.

"Thanks for fixing Freja and shotgun. But is Cassidy's ""Quick Draw"" Minor Perk causing pre-holding Right-Click immediately after Flashbang / Combat Roll not functioning also a bug, or intended?",Competitiveoverwatch,32,1kao5gb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1kao5gb/thanks_for_fixing_freja_and_shotgun_but_is/,2,2025-04-29 15:38:06,"Basic info:

* Cassidy's Minor Perk ""Quick Draw"" makes the ""Fan the Hammer"" individually controlled and can crit for 50% more damage.
* If this perk is selected, and the player, immediately after using the Flashbang or Combat Roll, holds the Fan the Hammer (right-click), Fan the Hammer will not start even after the Flashbang / Combat animation ends. **Player has to make sure previous animation has ended to start Fan the Hammer.**
* Expected behaviour: as long as the player holds the right-click, Cassidy should start Fanning the Hammer once all previous animation ends / allows.

the only way to fix sombra is making her unpopular again,Competitiveoverwatch,0,1ka0kjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1ka0kjj/the_only_way_to_fix_sombra_is_making_her/,82,2025-04-28 18:59:51,"
Sombra used to be by far the least played hero in the game. sombra is never gonna lose invisibility, grow up. that’s as unreachable as echo losing duplicate or ball losing grapple. 

the only solution is making her unpopular again. not just trash tier, but downright terrible for lower ranks, HARD TO PLAY, as she once was.  almost two years  ago she got reworked into a noob stomper hero. why? who wanted this? who benefited from this? 

i have never heard more sombra discourse in my life than after this dogshit rework and the dogshit rework that followed it. literally who likes this iteration of sombra whose only benefit is being able to kill dogshit players on cooldown. go play sombra in gold- you go behind them, virus and shoot. they insta die, people can’t even turn around. again, who wanted this? sombra used to be played by the top tier players that had the most and best coordination out there. i guarantee you put bans in ow1 sombra would never get banned. nobody played sombra back then besides at high elo. 

everything since that rework just fully solidifies her into a hero built to kill dogshit players and do nothing else. the perk she got not long ago is genuinely just good vs low rank players. 

obviously can’t just paste ow1 sombra… but personally her lethality has to go, same with virus. she needs to enable her team to be lethal, an invisible hero can’t just go around killing people. 

my suggestion

 6 seconds 75% speed (as she did in 2017)

infinite trans locator with cd on cast (latest iteration before the rework)

virus removed 

1s hack silence (weakest silence iteration we’ve had) 8s opportunist for a bit extra damage (was it 25%? whatever is the lowest it’s been) keep the short CD on health packs. 

emp 3s silence period. we’ve had worse emp iterations, but they mostly revolved around virus and insta killing a support. i feel like 3s is healthier.

If the first duration of hover is over and you start to fall, you can’t activate the second one. It has to occur during the first."

Does any soldier player actually want bigger bullets?,Competitiveoverwatch,0,1jk5a7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1jk5a7o/does_any_soldier_player_actually_want_bigger/,88,2025-03-26 07:16:33,"What exactly is the target demographic for this change? As far as I am aware, every soldier player above masters actually cares about getting better at aiming and derives pleasure from improving their aim. And any soldier that isn't on console and aspiring to be masters+ feels the exact same way

This was a hotfix change which means that somehow soldier's performance was bad enough after the midseason change (surely it wasn't already bad enough post season 9 to get this change before now?) to warrant it. Soldier got hotfix nerfed for having 0.09 bullet size a week or two after season the season 9 changes but pharah was allowed to be uber op for at least 5-6 months

Soldier still feels like absolute doo-doo because no matter how much effort and how much better I am than the other players in my game, they can just pick sojourn or torb and pick their boogers and get way too much value from doing that. It is literally better to swap off of soldier as someone who has mastered the hero because it takes so much more effort to just enjoy the hero than it is to lock in any other dps and put my feet on my desk

This character just doesn't do enough damage to warrant picking him most of the time. Consistent dps is completely worthless if you have 0 ability to finish people off by yourself. Tracer has 220 dps while soldier has 171 and tracer can easily get herself into positions (with minimal downtime/prep unlike soldier) where she can easily unload all of that dps with minimal pressure. In order to do ""damage"" as soldier, you have to either pray you can hard flank and get away with it or you have to put yourself in a position where you WILL easily be killed by any other hero in the game. You put yourself in this position to do damage and then you get stat checked by MANY different heroes in 1v1s, especially after season 9.

Most of the soldier players I am aware of care about aiming and doing damage, not being forced to play a character where the only thing he can do is perma kite (TERRIBLY before he gets his major perk) and bait people to look at him. Doing that is only realistically possible on some maps unless the enemy team turns their monitor off (imagine offense first point temple of anubis you literally can't flank and surprise people and that's how a lot of the maps are designed).
 
This bullet size change is spit in our face because it makes the character LESS FUN for us and doesn't actually do anything to make him more viable or playable. The bullet size increase isn't going to fix his god awful breakpoints

Should DIRE TRIGGERS be moved to Reapers base kit?,Competitiveoverwatch,56,1jh9f2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1jh9f2l/should_dire_triggers_be_moved_to_reapers_base_kit/,38,2025-03-22 15:17:16,"This question appeared in my head yesterday when I tried to play Reaper a bit yesterday. We were waiting for a rework of this hero for quite some time and recently the devs answered its no longer the priority. The perk with alt fire gives him option to deal some dmg at range, which was always his biggest problem and which I think they were trying to fix. Alt fire is fun to use, especially after the balance patch that reduced the recovery time, adds some more depth to the hero and flows really well with the rest of his abilites (something that I cannot say about Reins shield bash for example). I feel like its one of the best perks introduced, the other major perk is really good too, but I think I will be picking Dire Triggers a lot more, just to have that other button to press. So if the perk is so nice why not just move it to the base kit?  


Similarly I really like the needler perk for Lifeweaver, but here his kit has already a lot of things going on. I understand why its a perk. For Reaper though, he is one of the earilest heroes, who has been really outkitted by the rest of the cast and if he is meta, its usually just thanks to the stats. This could give the devs another thing to tune in terms of balance and if we need new perks I would focus on giving the alt fire some different effects (tightening the spread even more or adding a bleed effect to it idk).

"leveling up to get perks is such a ""shoot yourself in the foot"" design. So much wasted potential",Competitiveoverwatch,0,1jh39x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1jh39x2/leveling_up_to_get_perks_is_such_a_shoot_yourself/,12,2025-03-22 08:41:38,"I still remember a month or two ago when teams were trying out bastion on esperanca. They were only picking bastion for his linholm explosive perk, but the perk came in so late that all those teams just ended up having a useless character for 3/4 of the match. I do admit that bastion did find some decent value with the perk, but it's situational and not enough to compensate for the lack of value that made up 3/4 of the match.

I've never been a supporter of perks. I think giving players agency in how they want to approach their characters is a great concept, but tying it to a leveling system is just stupid. I guarantee you bastion would see a lot more playtime in pro matches if bastion gets to switch between his normal machine gun and linholm explosive at the beginning of the match. It adds choices and utility into his kit.

I think the same thing goes for other characters that have perks that can change your playstyle. For example, sombra. Why can't we just rework her and have white hat as a part of her passive(and we can maybe tone down other oppressive parts in compensation)? It's such a wasted potential.

For other characters with perks that compensate their weaknesses, I think we should also just have them as actual passive instead of a perk that will only be triggered after 3/4 of a match. For example, the reaper right-click perk. I agree it would be a bit to strong to be a passive from the start of the game, but with some nerfs to it, I think it would make reaper's gameplay a lot more dynamic and flexible. It's just a wasted potential. The same goes for ram's vortex perk. If ram has it from the start of a match, he would be able to deny other heroes high ground a lot more(like how he was advertised as a pharah counter before release), and the vortex could be used more strategically."
Is the casual playerbase overblowing Zarya's strength or am I just going insane?,Competitiveoverwatch,131,1jfvd0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1jfvd0b/is_the_casual_playerbase_overblowing_zaryas/,110,2025-03-20 19:09:00,"Before I begin, I do want to quickly mention that I do not want to sound elitist or come off with the ""skill issue"" type of argument here. Zarya in her current state is undoubtedly one the stronger tanks right and I have been seeing a ton of Zarya doing good work all across every game I've played this season

However, what boggles me is that a lot of the (casual) playerbase seems to argue that she is the single strongest tank currently and that she (with Sojourn which is more understandable) is ruining every ranked game. While I understand she's undoubtedly strong (personally playing Zarya myself), I really don't see what makes her suddenly stronger than in previous seasons when her balance state was almost identical. She didn't receive any significant buffs in the previous seasons. Her perks, while undoubtedly good, are not so impactful that it flips her counter matchup nor does it massively fix her natural kit issues (taking high ground quickly, low personal mobility).

Anecdotally, while she is definitely on the stronger side of tanks, playing tank myself I've never felt the urgent need to swap heroes just to counter the Zarya ALONE; if I'm swapping its always because of the tank mismatch with the Zarya's DPS line instead. Standard tank heroes like Hazard, Winston, Mauga, Ramattra, Ball and even DVa on high ground maps all have either neutral or favorable matchups and I never had significant issues playing into Zarya with most of these heroes if me and my team is playing somewhat competently.

Finally, if anything, Mauga currently is by far the most excruciating tank in a matchup when you're facing a halfway competent one since his kit design is so naturally oppressive to a majority of the tank cast in his current ""balanced"" state. Yet, I have yet to see any major complaints on the hero.

Would love to hear some thoughts on this.

EDIT: Quick edit here; when I say I don't see major complaints about Mauga, I'm referring primarily to the casual playerbase and their primary focus on Zarya over Mauga, which I believe is significantly more oppressive and frustrating to play against than Zarya"

sojourn is by far the best dps in the game and she went untouched 

ana’s perks have been the most complained about because of how op they are and she went untouched 

meis wall perk was 100% useless and had a gigantic downside to it. now it’s just useless. for the non mei players you could go literal weeks if not months before this perk is useful even a single time. it’s great for griefing though, long ass wall on spawn doors. 

torb got nerfed rightfully so, but tracer who was already running rampart with her op perks went untouched (glad for this ig? but still not healthy) especially when they didn’t do anything to make flashback not the obvious choice 

echo went unchanged despite being underwhelming and with dogshit major perks, pharah got a big buff to her unpopular minor while her two extremely powerful other perks went untouched. personally i think vacuum blast is too fun and way too op but i play pharah so 


rams shield perk is garbage game design like spilo said it’s not engaging at all 


sombra had four actual dogshit perks and now only three of them are dogshit. will have to test stack overflows new range but this shit is a lose-lose scenario. it’s either still worthless garbage or it isn’t and everyone has less fun playing ow getting hacked for twice the duration because of extremely lazy game design.

hog and winston buffs are just brainless number increases for two perks that are gonna go unused anyway because they are niche and boring 

juno got a buff because if there’s one thing juno needed was a buff 

a handful of good changes here like for lw and illari, but overall i’m disappointed in the lack of effort and vision and in particular of the extreme power creep. nothing good comes out of that garbage. it gave us goats, it gave us double shield, it gave us mei reaper, it gave us double shield. annihilating the chances for long term balance so they can get short term gratification buffing everyone and their mom every patch. what are your early thoughts

Or the enemy team seems to be bad, like the funny clip of the Bastion going on a wild goose chase that got posted on the main OW subreddit. Terrible gameplay, but peak comedic OW.

I honestly haven’t seen self repairing Bastion being oppressive and unfair. Though I  haven’t seen much Bastion lately. I do think self repairing should have a meter, but infinite self repair doesn’t seem as unfair as the clips make it out to be.

Hot take,Competitiveoverwatch,0,1j6f5hb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1j6f5hb/hot_take/,24,2025-03-08 12:23:27,"Hot take: ball and doom are egregiously overpowered until you run Sombra. 

With the perks it’s especially ball but I maintain this opinion for both characters. 

Here’s where I’m coming from: by all means wrecking ball and doom are ridiculously difficult to play and some of the hardest characters in a game. Their skill ceiling knows almost no limits. 

But they both have an extremely annoying frustrating ability. For ball this is his adaptive shields that give him health and for doom it’s his empowered punch. I can’t help but feel like these abilities are too strong because ball gets infinite uptime from it and doom gets crazy output if people shoot his punch (which is extra extra annoying because you might not be shooting his punch - it might be ur 400 overloaded torb charging it but then 3 seconds later you’re the 250hp squishie that pays the price). 

Here’s the catch. Sombra basically denies their entire character which is conversely really frustrating for doom and ball players. The result is either you don’t go Sombra and they’re extremely oppressive or you go Sombra and they become utterly useless unless they majorly skill diff the Sombra. 

I think ball and doom need power shifted from these abilities to other parts of their kit such that they can still maintain good output even with a Sombra on the team but they don’t feel annoying to deal with when there is no Sombra on the team. I think everyone would prefer this. 

Edit to add: a lot of people are saying that Sombra is not oppressive or that hero x y or z is more oppressive than Sombra but this only makes my point more pertinent - these heroes are still really strong and oppressive en masse until you run one hero that shuts them down entirely and then they’re useless which is poor design that sucks for ball/doom players and also for everyone at their mercy.

Junker Queen Major Perk Nerf,Competitiveoverwatch,0,1j5ge26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1j5ge26/junker_queen_major_perk_nerf/,9,2025-03-07 06:35:44,"https://preview.redd.it/2q4r7p7df7ne1.png?width=710&format=png&auto=webp&s=af1ea18ad4456c02279401fe426dc5aa06a33924

Didn't play for a couple days and came back today. Played Junker queen and when I selected the Rampage perk for her major perk I noticed that the symbol was different. Looked at the perk explanation to find it now applies to Carnage instead but I looked at the patch notes with no mention of the change. Has there been other hero perk changes that were never mentioned?"
Ideas I hope the devs would consider,Competitiveoverwatch,0,1j49xz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1j49xz4/ideas_i_hope_the_devs_would_consider/,8,2025-03-05 19:24:41,"**Sombra** \- have you guys considered **binding invis to crouch**? baptiste and wrecking ball have abilities binded to crouch, so its nothing new... if invis could be activated either by translocating or by crouching for 1,5 seconds it could be its own cooldown. And it makes sense, since crouch already is the ""no sound/stealth"" button for every character. That idea is not revolutionary, but its also easy to fly under the radar, so i'm including this topic just to double check if the devs remembered to put some thought into this possibility....  
  
**Ramattra** \- please don't consider ramatras extended shield duration perk one of the ""boring ones"". Since orissa's rework, the only tank viable for a real poke comp has been sigma. With ramattra's extended shield and orissa shield perk i can finaly have **variety in options when playing with or aginst a poke comp**. (orissa is much more interesting and fun with the shield btw). This topic is just to reassure you that this perk is not disposable, it is really important for the people who love the poke playstyle.

**Bastion** \- Invest as much dev time as necessary to actualy bring back the **tank form visuals** to the tank form perk, its worth it, i swear. (this one is not as serious as the others, but i mean it LOL)  
  
**Zenyatta** \- i have always been drawn to the healer role in every game i play. I find more joy in seing alied healthbars going up than seeing enemy healthbar going down. But Zenyatta has always appealed to me in the visual and lore department. And although his gameplan doesn't really fit my usual playstyle, he is the suport i have the most hours with. With the anouncement of perks **i was excited to maybe finally have a ""healer build"" for zenyatta**, but unfortunately that was not the case... his major perk that increase heals is still dependent on damaging the enemy, so my ability to burst heal my allies is limited by the actions of my enemies (Ex. dont matter how good my orb management is, if the enemy rein hold shield in the frontline on the exact moment i need the extra healing to save an ally, there is nothing i can do about it). So i strongly suggest you guys put some thouht in some zenyatta perk that enables a more heal focus playstyle that dont bind my playmaking potential to the actions of the enemy. Just to cement my point: you guys are games designers, so i believe you know that very popular simplification of the role trinity interaction: tanks focus on ""enemy to ally"" interaction, damage focus on ""ally to enemy"" interaction, and suports focus on ""ally to ally"" interaction. The zenyatta perk is at odds with this concept because it put an interaction with the enemy in between his primary way of interacting with his allies  
  
(One idea of perk i have been considering for zenny is maybe a 25hp healing burst when harmony orb changes targets, so zenny has to chose between keep shooting to maximise damage or keep switching orbs to maximise healing, or even trying to keep the flow of animation canceling, which would bring a cool new form of skill experssion... but this post is not about ability theoricrafting, so i digress...)  


**Conclusion:** this posts is directly adressed to the devs, but it is not a complaint, neither is about balance suggestions. This is strictily about the feel of some perks. I dont think i know it all and i know that my suggestions are not perfect, but i sincerely think that those are some bullet points that deserve to be at least taken into accont whenever the team is planning the perk refresh... i know it is unlikely, but still i hope some community manager can get this kind of feedback to the ear of the devs... i have no data to prove that the points i raised affect many people, but they are very relevant to my experience with the game, and dont believe i'm totally alone on my perspectives.

Suggestion: give us a 10-second grace period to change our perk selection,Competitiveoverwatch,76,1j1dgfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1j1dgfc/suggestion_give_us_a_10second_grace_period_to/,18,2025-03-02 00:54:59,"The devs recently did an AMA where they said they don't attend to let you change perks after they've been selected. Personally, I prefer it that way. This adds real weight to the decision-making, which makes it a far more intriguing system.

However, misclicks do happen, and they also acknowledged that this was something they could maybe try to address. I think a simple grace period after making your selection would suffice.

Imagine, for example: After picking your perk, a 10-second timer wheel appears on the bottom left next to your level. While that wheel is still there, the choice of perks is still available. 10 seconds is enough time to realize you've made a mistake and correct it, but not enough time to use the chosen perk for a fight, and then swap later.

Typically, when I choose the wrong perk, I know it immediately. I know it before the perk menu even closes. I think a 10 second grace period would be exactly what we need to alleviate that feels-bad moment that comes from mistakes like that."

The minor ones are just ""same thing but better."" Although either one could be the better choice depending on the challenges you face, so at least there's that.



But the major perks are genuinely S-Tier game design. The best abilities in OW have always been those that can be used in multiple ways. This gives the character intriguing moment-to-moment choices they have to make during a fight. Ramattra's biggest issue was always that his kit lacked this depth. He felt ""solved."" It was never hard to tell what the best option was in the middle of the fight since his kit had very little decision-making to it. Sure, it has a bit of skill expression in aiming and placing the vortex properly, but once you found a good target for those abilities, there was never a reason to change your approach throughout the game.


But things are completely different with his major perks. Nanite Repair gives you the option to either use Vortex traditionally (as a space-threatener that makes targets more vulnerable to your attacks) or more defensively (thrown close to you, to extend your presence in the fight). Vengeful Vortex seems like it's solely designed to deal with flyers, but it also allows you to more easily drop Vortex on snipers sitting on distant high ground, or on a closer target you just want to pressure with the additional 50 damage.

Whichever one you choose depends on the overall state of the game, and how you use either can change between team fights. That's exactly what he was missing before and he is a hundred times more fun to play now!"

But now we have a mechanic which can specifically fix those things without forcing any of the existing mains to change those aspects of their hero. 

The current perks suck at doing this and should be changed. For both heroes, each level should be a choice between something which adds a skill-expressive replacement to one of their abilities, and a quality of life buff that people who aren’t interested can take. 

Currently, their perks are very disappointing because they miss an obvious opportunity to “fix” the heroes without also ruining them for the people who currently see nothing that would need fixing.

This is obviously going to be somewhat limited - you aren’t going to turn mercy into tracer with two skill swaps - but it could help a lot."
Tracer Major Perk Idea - Damage Boost on Triple-Blink,Competitiveoverwatch,0,1iuky3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1iuky3d/tracer_major_perk_idea_damage_boost_on_tripleblink/,20,2025-02-21 08:00:48,"I think most reasonable people would agree that the perk to refresh all 3 blinks on recall is... unreasonable (and I play Tracer pretty much exclusively, myself.)

The replacement suggestion is:
**Triple-blinking grants a 10% damage boost to bullet and melee damage for 2 seconds.**

This will increase bullet damage to 6.05 and melee damage to 44, significantly increasing her one-clip potential.


Rationale:
One-clipping squishies is one of the most satisfying aspects of playing Tracer. This experience mostly disappeared with the increased health pools and her bullet damage falling to 5.5 (which is good for the health of the game, imo).

Tying it to triple-blink makes it situational, and encourages aggressive plays before a fight has started, or to aggressively chase down isolated targets, while discouraging its usage in a team fight because you'll need to burn all your blinks to proc it.


Why only 2 seconds?
2 seconds is plenty of time to one-clip a squishy (it takes one second to shoot a full clip, so you have wiggle room for trigger discipline).  

3 seconds would allow one blink to come back and perhaps make the ability too strong. The idea is to attempt the one-clip and recall the hell out of there.


Works well holistically:
This idea contrasts well with the other major perk (that makes you tankier on recall and encourages you to stay in the fight.) 

This now introduces a clear choice to make between the two perks depending on your playstyle or the enemy's team comp. As of now, the 3-blink refund is a no-brainer, which isn't a fun perk system."

The match quality has been atrocious and I genuinely don't think I made any impact in most of my games yesterday. I can go 25-4 and lose, then go 10-7 and win. You'll say stats don't matter but I'm telling you my performances where night and day, yet so were the results.

Edit: It's weird cause on Tuesday with the new Tracer perks I felt invincible and was just farming left and right, but Wednesday it's like everyone figured out how their own perks were and now I'm doing air lol. Might just be washed.

And for the love of all that is holy, what is with the mercy insta locks? 70% of my games have been Mercy mirrors and their asses will not switch whatsoever.

Perks are for sure a net positive but I feel it's going to take a while before lobbies are actually balanced because every game has at least one player that just so obviously shouldn't be there. So how is it going for y'all?

Sojourn 150% charge ultimate perk

Testing done 19-2-2025

Settings to get these numbers: Used Practice Range 4.2 Code:[DR8EP] and setting ability cooldown to on and ult generation to 500% (perk xp rate is tied to ult charge rate unsure if this is workshop workaround or normal gameplay would be mildly interesting if tank passive meant shooting them gave less xp).

**D.VA**  

Micros Missiles total barrage does: 153 no armor 126 with armor

Heavy Missiles total Barrage does: 168 no armor 140 with armor 

Notes/Thoughts Micro Missiles fires  18 projectiles vs Heavy missiles 8 given I have seen general feed back that heavy missiles really helps with damage i assume it's mostly just a matter of less shots at a slower pace means players hit a much higher percentage of the barrage.

**Reinhardt**

ShieldBash 50 normal 43 against armor

Note where your cross hair is placed determines the launch angle of the boop (so looking upwards launches them higher into the air)

**Hazard**: Damage on his leap seems to be correct at 30% change.

**Orissa** I've seen people say charged spear seems to do more damage, but testing it seems to be the same as normal i assume its' either placebo or extra knock back enacting the wall pin damage.   

**Rammatra** 
Normal Ram staff does 500 damage if all 100 shots hit.

Void Surge Activates every 20 shots of continous fire (tap firing in even tiny fractions of a second seems to reset it) does 650 if all 100shots+5bursts hit 

Vengeful Vortex unsure if it's a true bug or just workshop shennanigans, but the 50 damage burst activates if you just let it explode on the ground 3-5+ meters away, but if you are within 1-2 meters and let it hit the ground it does the normal vortex damage.

**Sigma**
Quick Melee: 40 damage, 33 with armor

Hyper Strike: 90 damage, 73 with armor

EDITED NOTE: Note where your cross hair is placed determines the launch angle of the boop (so looking upwards launches them higher into the air)

Note: Tool tip doesn't mention this at all.  And although might be workshop shennanigans armor seems to be reducing its damage by 17 it must be some time of DoT with really short duration.

**Monkey**
Heavy Landing does 75% more max as advertised (105 max)

Normal lightning gun 60, 60 against armor

Chain Lightning gun 60-48-36 (144 total), against armor 60-41-29 (130 total)

Note: Bounce being affected by armor is really weird maybe using really old PvE code from before lightning ignored armor?

**Ball**
All his tool tips seem correct on their damage numbers.

**Reaper**

Dire Triggers: 130 to the body 260 to the head.  Armor reduces damage to 65, and 130. Due to Tank passive Orissa turns 260 into 97 damage.  

Notes: at 20m i was doing about 12 damage center mass with a normal reaper shot and still getting 75-90 center mass. with Dire Triggers.

**Sojurn** 

EDIT:    

Normal Disruptor shot does 280 damage total ignore armor

Adhesive Siphon Disruptor shot does 148 damage total ignore armor (gives 36% charge)


Normal Railgun 120, 180 headshot 

Overcharged 150% Railgun: 170, 255 headshot

Note: Due to 1.5 headshot multiplier it ignores tank passive

**EDIT NUMBER 2 Because tool tips are hard**

Normal Sojourn Slide:  Starting at 0m if you slide and don't jump you'll end up roughly 15-16m away

Dual Thrusters Slide: Starting at 0m if you slide and don't jump you'll end up roughly 11-12m away


**Cassidy**

Quick Draw:  Headshots do 67.5 (way Overwatch displays decimals is messy) Against armor about 60.  

Note: Due to 1.5 headshot multiplier it ignores tank passive

**Ashe**
Vipers sting is a Damage over time, and Armor reduces it by 50% to 12.5 from what i can tell.

**Echo**

Normal Stickies 180 (**EDIT** 123 against armor)

Full Salvo 236 (**EDIT** 151 against armor)

Note actually hitting 50% more stickies on a moving target is tough, though combo'd with something like grav and it could be scary.

**Genji** 
Tool tips seem to be right about 25 damage

**Hanzo**
Scatter arrow splits into 3 each doing 25 damage didn't seem to be able to headshot with them (i could have just missed)

**Bastion**
Lindholm Explosives (Grenade turret form) does 140 a shot, 133 against armor

Notes Total Damage of normal turret form if all bullets hit on no armor is about 2111 and Lindholm Explosives form total damage is about 1120.  At about 18-28m aiming at a stationary hog normal turret form still outputs More or about equal to Lindholm explosives on unarmored targets.   Against skinny targets Lindholm form does far far better, but for tank busting normal turret form seems much better.

**Junkrat**
His tool tips seem to be correct

**LifeWeaver**
The thorns activate after 15-16 thorns (life weaver fires in bursts of 2) 30 damage appear to be correct armor reduces to 23.

**Brig**
Damage seems to be right on tooltip

**Juno**
Mediblaster 90 body 45 armor 

Headshot 135 armored headshot 68


Note: Due to 1.5 headshot multiplier it ignores tank passive

**Ana**

Ana Bodyshots 75 damage and ignore armor

Ana Headshots do 113 and ignore armor


Note: Due to 1.5 headshot multiplier it ignores tank passive


General notes and thoughts:  The actual DPS changes on some of these are quite different from what i originally assumed.  Juno only having a 1.5x multiplier and spread across a 12 round burst makes it less busted than i assumed.   Sigma quick melee doing 90 damage not being in the tool tip is nuts, Melee->Rock->Primary Fire is now a 320 damage combo and super easy to land on Brawl or dive tanks that want to get close to Sigma.

EDIT:  Thanks to u/apples_rey for pointing out the 1.5x headshot multiplier ignores tank passive.    And thanks to u/Dullorin for pointing out shield bash which i had originally forgotten."

best and worst perks,Competitiveoverwatch,24,1itg6b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1itg6b7/best_and_worst_perks/,64,2025-02-19 21:48:20,"i have a decent game count so far to give my opinion on some perks. it’d be cool if we could compile what we think are the best and worst perks for each hero. 

before that i’d like to ask for a few QoL changes to perks, first it would be amazing if we could classify perk 1 and 2 as A and B and then we could bind a specific button for that perk. that way i can bind my favorite perks on every hero to always be on M2. second it would be great if echo could still get perk progress while duplicating AND could choose a perk while in dupe.  

my thoughts on the heroes i’ve played:

+ Sombra

both her tier 2 perks are dog but they are fairly balanced between them. i’d say pick virus reset on kill. 

for tier 3 perks they are kinda baffling as both actively make my hacking experience worse. if one keeps practicing and plays with low hack sens though the white hat one should be good for emp. 1s extra on silence would barely be in line with other perks but the range reduction is brutal. feels like a straight nerf 

+ Pharah 

played a lot of pharah. both her tier 2 perks are chill not too powerful and i think comp dependant. playing without a zen mercy or brig  i usually took the shields. 

for tier 3 i don’t like the vaccum blast because it messes with my escape. i don’t like the fact it also pulls you in, i like the mobility so i think the extra fuel is better (and also boring)

+ Echo 

my most played hero so far. i like both the tier 2 picks and i think they r situational (they have dog hero picks for dupe but your team doesn’t) but i personally just fell in love with the extra time in dupe. been asking for that for years and it makes everything so much more flexible since i can now dupe sigmas and illaris and ana’s so much more often.  

as for tier 3, i like all and think they are balanced. beam reset is very useful vs certain dps you wanna flank. 

+ Venture

much like sombra ventures perks are very uninspiring. tier 2 i choose blindsight 9 times out of 10 tho

for tier 3 i think extra range is the better choice but i don’t think the other one is terrible

Especially as a flex player, it feels like the game has given me 168 new toys to play with, each one allowing for new playstyles to be uncovered, and this excitement of discovery and possibilities hasn't been present in the game for a long time.

I also haven't felt the need to counter anymore, since playing to my perks' strengths seem to allow heroes to work even against their counters.

The system is probably not perfect and sameness or other problems will eventually settle in again, but it feels like a bright start, and I can't help but wonder where they could take this system in the future?

Should they keep it as is and only balance or substitute over/underperforming perks? Or could they expand the system? Imagine having 3 perk levels, with 4 options each? Or maybe each hero skill could have two perks to choose. The possibilities are endless."

Hero Design: Learning from MOBAs for Overwatch 2’s Future,Competitiveoverwatch,48,1iqmhpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1iqmhpo/hero_design_learning_from_mobas_for_overwatch_2s/,16,2025-02-16 07:52:36,"With the announcement of Freya & Aqua, it’s got me thinking about hero design in Overwatch 2 and how it might evolve as the hero roster grows. MOBAs, with their massive rosters—Dota 2 and League of Legends alone have a combined 296 heroes—have faced similar challenges in creating fresh, unique heroes over the years.

Both MOBAs have also implemented hero ban systems, which Overwatch 2 has just announced it will be adding. Last year Dota 2 introduced 'facets,' which is strikingly similar to Overwatch 2’s upcoming perk system. These systems have had a big impact on game balance and strategy in MOBAs, at least in Dota so it’s interesting to see Overwatch 2 adopt similar concepts along with hero bans, as both Dota and League have had.

Are there any design takeaways from MOBAs that could help expand the Overwatch 2 hero pool in meaningful ways? Is there an inevitable limit to creating ‘unique’ FPS heroes as the roster grows?

Having played both Dota 2 and League of Legends before switching to Overwatch 2, I can’t help but imagine how some of the most fun and satisfying heroes in MOBAs could be adapted to FPS. For example, Invoker in Dota 2 is one of my all-time favorite heroes, but I’ve struggled to theory craft its core mechanics into an FPS setting.

For those of you who’ve played MOBAs, are there any hero abilities or concepts you’d love to see make their way into Overwatch 2? What could Overwatch 2 learn from the way MOBAs design their ever-expanding rosters?

EDIT: For anyone who hasn't played either MOBA before but is interested in the general design or abilities of the heroes for inspiration here are the links to them:  
Dota 2 (https://www.dota2.com/heroes)

I mean, it almost feels like there's a few different versions of Overwatch in people's minds. It probably depends on how much you've kept up with the game and how into it you are, and I think that there's been a lot of people that have stuck with Overwatch over the years that have really noticed the care and attention that we've put into it since Overwatch 2 has shipped. Especially over the course of the last year, we've really focused on leveling up the game. I hope those people really see that with a lot of the things we've been sharing lately, and hopefully that can spread out to the broader community as well.

>But [on the other hand] I understand, you know? I understand when people have that particular view. They thought that the game was going to be something that it didn't end up being – I get the criticism, but from the team's point of view, the only thing that we can do about that now is to make the best version of this game that we can.

He knows who truly cares about the game, and it's for them that he services the current changes

But at the same time, he understands that Overwatch is a whole identity, and that there are others who have hopes for what is possible for Overwatch

Jeff wanted change but one has to change themselves too to service that, and so Aaron actually  changed the game to fit that mold and vision. 

Based on recent comments, and even considering how vehemently the greater community perceive the lack of PvE, it almost feels like PvE is something the team will forever have to consider if they want to establish further goodwill, but I think all the comments recently indicate that is simply something that will take some thinking and planning on how Overwatch can truly integrate that into the current PvP landscape. 

The easily solution is starting with PvPvE modes with a build towards MOBA... Stadium as a whole is just a great way to test so many ideas now and different ways to experience Overwatch now. 

But I think what's interesting is that the Ramattra and Null Sector invasion is still a canon event, it's something they have already drafted and probably have multiple cutscenes in the work for, so just like they retooled Talents to Perks and Stadium... 

I wonder if there's a world where Overwatch can service its PvE story the way Destiny did with its seasonal model. 

Talents and Perks allows for a lot more customization, and those same abilities can likely be used by enemies too. 

Imagine a 3 phase Ramattra boss battle which relies on different mechanics used both by the Heroes through fixed perks, but also giving the bosses like Ramattra totally different mechanics so the PvE encounters don't fail.

I think it's interesting because Invasion likely gave them good feedback on why PvE just wasn't interesting and they likely knew this, and yet they still teased future story, but we've actually seen the Zenyatta missions years ago, so I can only imagine that they may somehow retool it to be used better. 

This may be the same reason they simply don't talk about PvE. Because there's no reason to until they have a solid plan for it. And they can take their time, even if it takes 5 years or more.

But a world where we can have potentially Overwatch Dungeons or Raids would be quite awesome. And I think such mechanics to tell the story may be a better way than generic missions as the emphasis would be on creative gameplay and the rewards that come with it than playing PvP maps with just basic bots. 

But overall, it's great to see that Aaron has big ideas and is willing to make the changes to fulfill them, while also allowing the playerbase to be part of such progression. "

The three main team comps: dive, spaml, brawl. Which usually informs a lot about your decision making. 

They play spam, we try to dive or out spam,   
They play brawl, we try to spam or out brawl,  
They play dive, we try to brawl or out spam, 

You can usually press tab and know what your playstyle should be like this game. But with the new perks, the character pick no longer tells the whole story. So i thought this could be a place to start strategizing, what does it mean when the pick barrier on orisa etc. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ My thoughts \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
**support**

ANA  
**minor**  
\- groggy, (Enemies waking up from Sleep Dart are slowed for two seconds.) anti brawl? keep the enemy tank from engaging? can't brawl without a tank. Or maybe anti dive since it can be used to protect from a flanker? though generally if you hit the sleep the fight is won anyway.  
\-Biotic bounce (After exploding, Biotic Grenade bounces and explodes again for 50 damage and healing.)  
no clue...  
**major**  
\- Headhunter, (Biotic Rifle can crit enemies). spam, making ana much more lethal and deprioritizing healing. Alternatively dive, ana is allready an oppurtunity creator with her nade and sleep but now also allowing you to burst  squishies.   
\- Shrike, (Using Nano Boost also casts it on Ana). I think this most benefits dive. Imagine getting dove and instead of folding you can nano your self to survive. while also setting up a counter dive.

KIRIKO  
**minor**  
\- fortune teller, *(two healing ofuda on landing a kunai),* leans brawl since it ups the sustain in a fight. You can easily hit body shots in a brawly fight while teammates are almost guarateed to be in front of you.  
*-* urgent care, (*Healing Ofuda projectile speed is increased by 50 percent when seeking critical health allies.),* leans anti dive, maybe? allowing you to keep up a dove team mate? unsure   
**major**  
*-*  Shuffling, *(Swift Step can be used again within four seconds of its initial cast),* leans dive, allowing you to tp in more safely.   
*-* Foxtrot, leans brawl (Protection Suzu grants 40 percent movement speed to allies for two seconds.) allowing you to cleanse debuffs on a approach for example. generally movement speed for alies bennefits brawl

LUCIO  
**minor**  
\- Bass Blowout (Soundwave’s knockback is increased by 15 percent), leans anti dive, allowing you to keep your squishies safe.   
\- Groovin (Regenerate four ammo per second while wall riding). at first though might seem like spam, but honestly what spam comp would run lucio? i'd say brawl just because that is the only scenario a lucio might reasonably be holding wallride on a wall. but it just doesnt seem that strong to me.  
**major**   
\- Noise Violation: (Crossfade’s range is increased by 150 percent while Amp It Up is active) leans brawl?   
\- Accelerando: (Lúcio’s attack speed is increased by 50 percent while Amp It Up is active) leans dive, allowing lucio to go in with the rest of the dive and be part of the burst in a scarier way. might be less good in the dive mirror.

Perks in comp?,Competitiveoverwatch,43,1ip7kx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1ip7kx7/perks_in_comp/,51,2025-02-14 11:20:31,"I’d love to get a civil discussion going about the perks being in competitive off day one. I’ve seen a lot of posts about the perks and people seem very divided on it. Some people hate it and some people love it. I can see both sides but I’d like to spark an objective discussion about its place in competitive. Here are my thoughts for starters.

I wish they’d take things slow. I get that, regardless of which you prefer, MR is posing some competition right now and OW has to cook something big. But as a long time overwatch and competitive player, I was already stoked for map voting and hero bans. I really think they’re good additions for competitive and can handle some counter swapping and frustrating issues in the game. 

Nobody has to versus widow anymore. I, as tracer, no longer have to deal with turrets and nobody needs to fight orisa for example. Simultaneously, we won’t have annoying map metas like widow on circuit royale. I wish they’d test this first. Just this change. I think it’s really healthy for competitive. 

The perks on the other hand, seems to be too all in if you catch my drift. I feel like it’s too disruptive. I’m not against the idea of the perks system (I loved junks lab) but I’m just against the idea of it immediately being added into comp. In my opinion, it seems really difficult to balance. And some advocate for the “everyone is op” outlook like in MR where everyone has some busted ability but imo one of the things I loved about overwatch was this lack of “randomness” that comes from everything being OP. The game feels way more grounded when you can basically play around everything because the abilities are not TOO strong. 

It also takes away from some of the “ranked-ness” of ranked. I have no idea how to describe this but basically I’ve been playing overwatch for years and years and every season I push for a better rank. I don’t want handouts from Tracer being super strong with her major perk and I don’t want snowball games from some enemies farming perks off winning the first few fights. I want to improve at the game. I feel like this reduces the competitiveness of the games. 

Of course, I could be completely and utterly wrong. Admittedly, I’m generally opposed to change. This could be a blast and revitalise the game for all I know. But then again, it can’t hurt to just leave it as an arcade mode and if it’s really successful, move it into comp? It just seems a gamble to immediately put it into comp. What do you guys think?"

Some personal notes

* There are 78 total upgrade tiers over 39 heroes, 2 perks per tier
* Some stuff I didn't include are more obvious/dominant pick at certain elos
* Many tiers have branching playstyle implication. Some other, not so much. More of the former would be good
* Perks with tradeoff nerfs are really good way to balance them. Why does Ana do full damage with first nade bounce hit but not Cass double flash?
* Should have included perks that address tank counters like Dva vs beam etc... Maybe potential balance change to base kit instead?
* Thank god DPS passive is at 25%
* Next season will be chaos, probably don't take it too seriously competitively. Hero bans + balance patches mean the season after will be much better
* Should've gotten more details on the EXP system, seems pretty important
* Very likely a lot of stuff is placeholder to be changed. Look at hog and soj. 15 ammo, really?"

I tried to target ones that looked less interesting or engaging and choose to ignore ones that seem too powerful.

# D.va:

Minor Perks:  
\[Bunny Stomp\] Landing from falling deals up to 60 damage around [D.va](http://D.va), and Call Mech’s damage radius is increased by 50 percent.

\[Replaces Ejection Suit\] Pilot [D.va](http://D.va) gains 2 abilities: Slide and Big Shot (from Heroes of the Storm)

# Doomfist:

Major Perks:

Major Perks:  
\[Replaces Quick Draw\] Flashbang is replaced by a slightly longer range Lasso. Enemies hit by this take no damage, but they are hindered for 1.5 sec, but Cassidy is also hindered for the duration.

# Mei:

Minor Perks:  
\[Replaces Permafrost\] Spraying the ground in front of Mei while walking forward increases her movement speed by up to 30% over 3 seconds, but if she stops she will continue to slide.

Major Perks:  
\[Replaces Biting Cold\] Mei’s Cyro-Freeze now forms a ball around her, and she will be able to move at a slower rate.

# Sombra:

Minor Perks:  
\[CTRL ALT ESC\]: Teleporting with Translocator reduces the cooldown of passive health regeneration by 50% or activates it if Sombra teleports at critical health.

Major Perks:  
\[Replaces Stack Overflow\] Translocator no longer teleports Sombra instantly, but it will now remain where thrown for 12 seconds and Sombra can teleport back at any time (cooldown starts when teleporting back). Additionally Sombra can now enter Stealth by crouching for 3 seconds.

# Mercy:

Minor Perks:  
\[Winged Reach\]: Guardian Angel’s range is increased by 30 percent and the ability starts it’s cooldown faster if the slingshot is canceled early.

# Zenyatta:

Minor Perk:

MMW: Perk system is going to worsen counterpicking so much that many matchup will go from 6:4 to 7:3,Competitiveoverwatch,0,1ioiaky,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1ioiaky/mmw_perk_system_is_going_to_worsen_counterpicking/,32,2025-02-13 13:48:01,"Imagine you're on Dva playing into Zarya. Let's say both of you reaches level 2 at the same time (Which is already a stretch because Zarya is probably going to be way faster). Zarya is going to gain verticality, so Dva can no longer avoid Zarya's beam by hiding on high grounds. Meanwhile, both of Dva's perks have zero impact before demach. This is going to snowball and result in the team with Zarya rolling over the team with Dva. Sure, Dva can swap, but then she is just giving up the entire first point. She can swap after the first or second teamfight, but then she would be giving up both ult charge and level. It is an extreme case, but it is generally true among all the counters.

Bastion gets more mobility while rein still has no solution to him. How is venture going to defeat a cass who can roll for every two shots? I wish every genji good luck fighting a moira with burst healing and longer fade. I also pray for every doomfist who has to face flying zenyatta and every tracer who needs to dive brig.

**In short, most of the buffs are either straight buffs to what heroes are already good at or irrelevant to the hero's weakness. Only about one or two specific perks actually address heroes' weakness and provide tools for it. This is going to result in counterswapping hell. I am not fundamentally against perks, but I do not see a future where this version of perks work out**"

Hero ban details from Spilo’s interview with Gavin Winter,Competitiveoverwatch,296,1iocro1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1iocro1/hero_ban_details_from_spilos_interview_with_gavin/,120,2025-02-13 07:15:03,"All points are taken from Spilo’s video available on YouTube here: https://youtu.be/5qQAcxtD3Uo?si=0IBMzpHoITzlc_aQ starts at 45:00 

- Wanted to prioritize speed with hero bans, ban phase is only 1 round, between 20-30 seconds. 
- Currently both teams will get two bans each. 
- Each player will get to pick up to three characters they want to ban, ordered from highest to lowest priority. Once the ban phase is complete the game will calculate which heroes to ban for each team based on the vote totals. Max of 4 heroes banned total. 
- Don’t expect there to be too many ties in voting but they do have tiebreaker systems in place just in case.
- Working on a system where players can show their preferred heroes to their team before the ban phase (seems similar to the pre-select phase in Marvel Rivals). Opportunity to tell your team what you want to play. 
- Gavin jokes: “If you tell your team that you want to play a hero that’s considered very weak, maybe they’ll ban your hero to stop you from playing it” 
- Both teams can’t ban the same hero. If this happens, the game counts the team that voted for that hero more as the team that banned that hero and select the next highest heroes from the other team. Gavin says there’s actually a complex order of operations going on behind the scene but the ban selections happen instantly for the players.
- Voice and text chat are enabled during the ban phase. 
- “We don’t think there’s a way to [game the system], we’ve thought about it a lot”
- Reiterates the system is still in-progress
- You will see the map first before deciding bans. 
- **You will NOT be able to see who is on the enemy team during the ban phase. Gavin says this was done specifically to avoid the issue of target banning.**
- Gavin on target banning: “I think hero bans should punch up at the strong things, and they should not punch down, and a lot of targeted bans would punch down.” Wants people to ban the “strong or annoying heroes” and not simply target OTPs. 
- You don’t have to choose 3 heroes to ban, you can choose anything between 0 and 3. 
- It is possible for less than 4 heroes to be banned in a match simply if not enough players vote.
- Hero bans will be implemented at every rank and will be exclusive to comp. Gavin says they don’t really have an argument for why they should deny bans to lower ranks. “If the bronze players are going to be wrong, let them be wrong.” 
- Team is going to be looking at ban data and which heroes get banned from a variety of angles including region, platform, and rank. 
- “I think there will be situations where people ban bad heroes that are annoying, and I think those people will probably drop in rank in some cases.” 
- Spilo jokes “but would you prefer to be low rank and enjoy the experience?” 
- One of the things they didn’t realize about bans early on that they do now is just novelty, it makes games different and more unique. 
- Slightly worried about ban metas but thinks they’re much less likely that previously thought.
- Will be listening to player feedback on the system. 
- Great perk of using a ranked choice system is that they can change things behind the scenes without having to overhaul the UI. 
- Gavin: “Excited for the rules I’ve written, but sure I’ll be wrong about something.” 
- Gavin notes someone in chat saying that characters will be banned based on map alone, says that’s a great point and a reason why they will show the map before bans start. 
- Says that hero winrates differ by +/- 10% based on the map. 
- Currently there’s a cap of 2 heroes banned per role. Gavin says this is to prevent 4 heroes in the Support and Tank cast specifically being banned since those pools are smaller. If more than 2 heroes of the same role are in the top ban picks, the top 2 get banned and the rest are skipped, moving on to the next highest voted characters from different roles. 
- Bans section ends there, after that they move on to competitive rewards.

"With perks and hero bans, Coaches are way more integral for a team’s success than previous years",Competitiveoverwatch,29,1io32bk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1io32bk/with_perks_and_hero_bans_coaches_are_way_more/,5,2025-02-12 23:01:07,"With the new perk system coming into overwatch and its immediate inclusion to the live game in a short amount of time, coaches have a lot of work cut out for them.

Every hero has 4 additional gameplay changes. That’s 168 new abilities to consider when forming compositions, on top of figuring out the meta, discussing hero bans for their enemy team for each map, workshopping different engages on the maps, etc 

A coach who can figure out the new perk system, on top of every other responsibility they have already, is going to be necessary for teams. Players need the burden of having a professional mind brainstorm all the abilities and how they interact with each other off their chest, so a coach who can do that well is crucial.

Keep in mind, the teams overall have less scrim time compared to the OWL days and meta’s already take longer to form, with teams figuring out what works mid-match. This perk system is going to result in some interesting matches, and I can’t wait to experience it as a viewer, but am sorry for the teams who will have to work this into their practices."
Stadium is awesome and healthy for the game.,Competitiveoverwatch,93,1io30is,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1io30is/stadium_is_awesome_and_healthy_for_the_game/,40,2025-02-12 22:59:03,"I've made posts/comments here multiple times how the game needs a proper, evolving Arcade mode, and they've added literally that which will be supported over time as a new identity to Overwatch. 

Like events are cool, but they just go away and then we didn't get any long lasting effect or improvement. 

But now they can give new identity to Stadium every season. 

And since they're open to new modes, also better than constantly adding core game modes before there are enough maps for them, this allows them to add completely new ways to play. 

An Overwatch style Battle Royale with upgrades through collecting perks/mods can actually be possible one day.

So essentially, Battle for Olympus but with more progression, on like expanded Flashpoint maps where you level up Heroes but instead finding upgrades. They can retool the item mechanic from PvE this way too, or even as a crafting mechanic. 

We can get a proper MOBA if they retool all the PvE engine changes, especially if they learn from Deadlock. Maps like Gothenburg could be used for it. 

We can get a CoD Zombies like endless Junkenstein/Bride, or at least a proper horde mode. 

For example, it wasn't justJunkenstein's Lab, but also the previous Trials of Sanctuary that helped build Stadium, so PvE inclusion only makes sense eventually. 

We can get a Risk of Rain 2 roguelite type mode, perhaps like Warframe Duviri Paradox (which could tell a small story) or Warframe 1998 where Heroes have locked in different mod kits

We can get a Le Sserafim type PvPvE mode, something like Destiny's Gambit

This all just seems like what the game wanted to keep expanding towards something bigger. Of course PvE didn't work, but Aaron did mention that both they're looking to expand how the game is played every year, and also that they're thinking about how to tell the story, so a proper way of incorporating PvE or MMO concepts like Destiny could be a real possibility one day. They clearly took their time to add perks and mods, so if they do it, realizing the expanded hope for Overwatch as an IP, they'll take their time and test it out properly.

(This isn't wishful thinking or hopium. What I'm saying is, they're building a live service the right way by testing and teasing content through live data and understanding what people like. If they can truly make great PvE and MMO content, they will take steps to try it the same way they did with perks even though many people were apprehensive at first about this too. They're making it a fun and transparent process by including the playerbase as part of it, and Trials, Le Sserafim and Cosmic Crsis are examples they do want to do _something_ with PvE) 

Even bringing a sort of Archives, or just using existing PvE, with weekly modifiers could be fun enough as a test. 

Think more of how Warframe has a small open world within its mission/mode instead of entire regions. 

This also adds on from the previous point. They're adding new map variants for Stadium, so who knows, maybe Garden Warfare 2's mini open world as an expanded Practice Range could work.

Perhaps they'll take more from Rivals and add duo/trio synergistic abilities too. 

This really finally feels like an expansion to the game that Overwatch always needed the same way Fortnite, Destiny, Warframe would expand how to play the game...PvE was supposed to be that, and it didn't work, but they used its failing and production quite well to tool towards something that works.

Now they're not killing the game to expand it but actually having players be part of that.

Swaping Hero makes you level 1 again, but faster level up

Eliminating people who are higher level gives more experience

Backfill gives you the worst player on the team's level, I believe

Also, Emongg is currently going through the Perks on his stream.

Edit: oh my, Juno can headshot with her perk.

And Tracer getting all Blinks back after Recall is crazy too.

They gave Lifeweaver the Needler from Halo

All directions point it to being true, at least from what we've seen and heard so far, but there's still a chance that it could be something entirely different.

But besides that, how'd ya want it? Extreme? Subtle? Passive? There's a lot of ways they could go about this.

How Could Blizzard Enhance the Social Aspect of Overwatch?,Competitiveoverwatch,69,1hsdazu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1hsdazu/how_could_blizzard_enhance_the_social_aspect_of/,62,2025-01-03 04:46:03,"Awhile ago, Aaron Keller said that the and the team envision Overwatch as a social shooter (something along these lines, it's hard to find the exact quote). I found this interesting, because I don't tend to think of Overwatch as a primarily social experience, nor does it necessarily lend itself to being one other than the fact that you play in a team and there is voice chat. Otherwise, it's no more social than any other multiplay game on the market, possibly less so. As such, I began to brainstorm ways that they could improve the social aspect of this game and I think I have some ideas ranging from probably fairly simple to implement to much larger undertakings. If you have any ideas of your own, I'd love to see them.

My first idea that I'd imagine would be a pretty easy change would be making quickplay lobbies continuous instances. Currently, games are made into individual matches, and once the game ends, everyone in that match disperses and they may never see each other again. This disincentivizes meaningful interaction and people are more likely to be toxic when they think they'll never see anybody in the lobby ever again. I think this is a small thing they could change and would be a pretty safe bet for enhancing the casual parts of quickplay. You could even have map voting in between maps.

My second idea would be geared towards reducing alt accounts, as I find that these naturally decrease sociability thanks to the anonymity granted by them. In order to play ranked, you should have to complete a set amount of games, and if you don't, it locks ranked for the next season. In order to unlock ranked again, you have to complete a set amount of games in quickplay. I think this would decrease smurfs, as they would need to play many more games so they're more likely to climb to their actual rank, and disincentivize alt accounts, because you'd have to play a lot more games on alt accounts than you would otherwise. It'd also make camping a rank harder. It's not necessarily impossible to play on an alt, but you would have to put in more hours and ""commit"" to an account a little more. And if you skip a season, you should probably be required to go back in quickplay and de-rust before jumping right into comp again. I think this is a good middle ground between banning alt accounts completely and letting them run wild.

My third idea would be a rework to career profiles. Players should have more control over what is shown on their profilem. The privacy setting for it shouldn't be a strict yes or no, but rather you should be able to pick and choose what you show on your profile. For example, maybe you'd like to show your top 3 most comfortable heroes, but you'd rather keep private the season you didn't have a very good record. In addition to this, there should be more information about the kind of player you are on the profile. Maybe you could have a list of archetypes you could choose that you believe would describe your playstyle. It's important that these are all things the player chooses, so that they don't accidentally show anything on their profile that would increase toxicity towards them and they're more likely to keep their profile open. You could even allow people to link their social media profiles on there.

My fourth idea would be revamping the post-game experience. Of course, they should bring back cards. That's been talked about before. But, on top of that, they should incorporate endorsements into it instead of the system being something you only sometimes remember to do for the battlepass xp. So the sequence goes potg->cards->endorsements, with endorsements being an entire screen that you're at least required to look at before leaving.

My fifth idea kind of goes hand in hand with that, they should revert/improve endorsements. Right now, a high endorsement level doesn't really indicate anything other than you either play the game a lot or you're a mercy player. The original system where you could choose between one of three types of endorsements was a good start, and I was disappointed to see them simplify it and make it mean even less. Bring those back, and maybe add a few more and each one could be worth different amounts. For example, a ""flexible"" endorsement which indicates that you're willing to switch around, but it wouldn't be worth as much as a shotcaller endorsement. Then, add more perks with high endorsement levels to incentivize reaching those levels. If you have a max endorsement level, you endorsements could mean more and you could display new things on your profile. Maybe people with high endorsements could leave comments that consist of set phrases (in order to avoid abuse) on each other's profiles, similar to steam profiles. My main goal behind endorsements is that they should mean something and they should indicate the kind of player you are.

My next couple thoughts relate more to the competitive aspect of the game, but I believe the competitive environment of overwatch naturally lends itself to social experiences.

Add clans. It seemed like it was a work in process at one point, but for whatever reason it seems to have been scrapped or greatly delayed.

They should bring back the lfg system, but also add an lft system that's tied in with clans and is intended to find a more permanent team to play with in the next two systems. You could tie in an improved endorsement and career profile to better get a sense of the kind of player you're trialing and the kind of team you're joining, which was an issue with the lfg system. This would also inherently make people more likely to care about endorsements if it affected how easily they could join a team.

Then, add an in-game scrim finder. Anyone who scrims, knows that finding scrims is kind of fucked right now. Team averages are all over the place, and this makes it harder to get consistently good practice. An in-game scrim finder would allow you to see the actual rank average of a team.

Finally, in-game tournaments. These have been talked to death, so I won't make this already long post any longer.

As I said earlier, while these are centered around the competitive ecosystem of the game, that lends itself to making the game even more social because it makes players more invested and less anonymous.

Finally, my idea that would probably take substantially more development time: an (actually) revamped training range. I'm talking a shared hub experience, that you and maybe 15 other players load into instead of a boring main menu. There could be minigames, areas players could show off cosmetics, 1v1 arenas, and even a place to watch owcs/high elo games with other players. There could be battlepass challenges that involve scavenger hunts around the map, and they could decorate it with each event. Chill/kill lobbies are huge, and this would be a step above those.

I'm probably not even scratching the surface here and these ideas could be more fleshed out, but I hope this gets the conversation started around making overwatch more social. I genuinely think it would solve a lot of issues in the game, and place it back on top of the market in terms of innovation, because this is an area that modern live service games have fallen behind."
