How Could Blizzard Enhance the Social Aspect of Overwatch Awhile ago Aaron Keller said that the and the team envision Overwatch as a social shooter something along these lines its hard to find the exact quote I found this interesting because I dont tend to think of Overwatch as a primarily social experience nor does it necessarily lend itself to being one other than the fact that you play in a team and there is voice chat Otherwise its no more social than any other multiplay game on the market possibly less so As such I began to brainstorm ways that they could improve the social aspect of this game and I think I have some ideas ranging from probably fairly simple to implement to much larger undertakings If you have any ideas of your own Id love to see them My first idea that Id imagine would be a pretty easy change would be making quickplay lobbies continuous instances Currently games are made into individual matches and once the game ends everyone in that match disperses and they may never see each other again This disincentivizes meaningful interaction and people are more likely to be toxic when they think theyll never see anybody in the lobby ever again I think this is a small thing they could change and would be a pretty safe bet for enhancing the casual parts of quickplay You could even have map voting in between maps My second idea would be geared towards reducing alt accounts as I find that these naturally decrease sociability thanks to the anonymity granted by them In order to play ranked you should have to complete a set amount of games and if you dont it locks ranked for the next season In order to unlock ranked again you have to complete a set amount of games in quickplay I think this would decrease smurfs as they would need to play many more games so theyre more likely to climb to their actual rank and disincentivize alt accounts because youd have to play a lot more games on alt accounts than you would otherwise Itd also make camping a rank harder Its not necessarily impossible to play on an alt but you would have to put in more hours and commit to an account a little more And if you skip a season you should probably be required to go back in quickplay and derust before jumping right into comp again I think this is a good middle ground between banning alt accounts completely and letting them run wild My third idea would be a rework to career profiles Players should have more control over what is shown on their profilem The privacy setting for it shouldnt be a strict yes or no but rather you should be able to pick and choose what you show on your profile For example maybe youd like to show your top 3 most comfortable heroes but youd rather keep private the season you didnt have a very good record In addition to this there should be more information about the kind of player you are on the profile Maybe you could have a list of archetypes you could choose that you believe would describe your playstyle Its important that these are all things the player chooses so that they dont accidentally show anything on their profile that would increase toxicity towards them and theyre more likely to keep their profile open You could even allow people to link their social media profiles on there My fourth idea would be revamping the postgame experience Of course they should bring back cards Thats been talked about before But on top of that they should incorporate endorsements into it instead of the system being something you only sometimes remember to do for the battlepass xp So the sequence goes potgcardsendorsements with endorsements being an entire screen that youre at least required to look at before leaving My fifth idea kind of goes hand in hand with that they should revertimprove endorsements Right now a high endorsement level doesnt really indicate anything other than you either play the game a lot or youre a mercy player The original system where you could choose between one of three types of endorsements was a good start and I was disappointed to see them simplify it and make it mean even less Bring those back and maybe add a few more and each one could be worth different amounts For example a flexible endorsement which indicates that youre willing to switch around but it wouldnt be worth as much as a shotcaller endorsement Then add more perks with high endorsement levels to incentivize reaching those levels If you have a max endorsement level you endorsements could mean more and you could display new things on your profile Maybe people with high endorsements could leave comments that consist of set phrases in order to avoid abuse on each others profiles similar to steam profiles My main goal behind endorsements is that they should mean something and they should indicate the kind of player you are My next couple thoughts relate more to the competitive aspect of the game but I believe the competitive environment of overwatch naturally lends itself to social experiences Add clans It seemed like it was a work in process at one point but for whatever reason it seems to have been scrapped or greatly delayed They should bring back the lfg system but also add an lft system thats tied in with clans and is intended to find a more permanent team to play with in the next two systems You could tie in an improved endorsement and career profile to better get a sense of the kind of player youre trialing and the kind of team youre joining which was an issue with the lfg system This would also inherently make people more likely to care about endorsements if it affected how easily they could join a team Then add an ingame scrim finder Anyone who scrims knows that finding scrims is kind of fucked right now Team averages are all over the place and this makes it harder to get consistently good practice An ingame scrim finder would allow you to see the actual rank average of a team Finally ingame tournaments These have been talked to death so I wont make this already long post any longer As I said earlier while these are centered around the competitive ecosystem of the game that lends itself to making the game even more social because it makes players more invested and less anonymous Finally my idea that would probably take substantially more development time an actually revamped training range Im talking a shared hub experience that you and maybe 15 other players load into instead of a boring main menu There could be minigames areas players could show off cosmetics 1v1 arenas and even a place to watch owcshigh elo games with other players There could be battlepass challenges that involve scavenger hunts around the map and they could decorate it with each event Chillkill lobbies are huge and this would be a step above those Im probably not even scratching the surface here and these ideas could be more fleshed out but I hope this gets the conversation started around making overwatch more social I genuinely think it would solve a lot of issues in the game and place it back on top of the market in terms of innovation because this is an area that modern live service games have fallen behind,How Could Blizzard Enhance the Social

Could S15s groundbreaking change be something other than a perk or ban system that achieves similarly goals As you know the devs have announced that there will be groundbreaking changes coming to overwatch for season 15 which has led to speculation over what such a change could be Many assume this will be a perk system and while I tend to agree a lot of discussion has happened about bans coming to overwatch These conversations became even more numerous after rivals launched with a ban system of their own However thats not when those conversations started Alec Dawson himself said in an interview in December of 2023 that they were considering a pick and ban system to adjust the impact swapping has in Overwatch In this interview he also mentioned they were testing other features such as a currency system for buying hero swaps Recently Gavin Winter has said their monitoring Rivals ban system and allegedly might have said they they arent currently working on one The devs seem to have adopted a philosophy inspired by a shitton of complaints among the community that the game should rely less on swapping as the primary way to make adjustments This along with the pickable passives test and the Junkrnstein LTM have led people to believe that a perk system is being added and will provide players with another way to make adjustments aside from swapping Now this could just be blizzard failing to choose their words carefully but a perk system isnt exactly a new concept Neither is a ban system Not what I would consider groundbreaking However theres a lot of room in the not working on a ban system statement for a different system that effectively pulls the game back from a swapfest especially without stopping you from picking certain heroes altogether Even as an offthecuff brainstorm idea a currency for swaps system would be more innovative than a ban or perk system Tldr Could the groundbreaking changes coming be at least partly a system that achieves the devs goal of lower the potency and necessity of swappingcountering while being more innovative than a just ban or perk system would be Edit My prediction is theyve added a currency system and locked both swaps and perks behind it but Im sure there are other systems like user chosen hero pools that would fit,Could S15s groundbreaking change be something other than a perk or ban system that

Opinions on the introduction of perks Im not gonna lie Im kinda of dreading perks in the game One of my favourite things about overwatch is the fact that everyone is given the same kit for each hero and you have to get the best out of it with your skill Perks to me needlessly complicate a game that is probably already overwhelming for new players In addition the overwatch team has enough trouble balancing the cast as is perks are likely going to make balancing so much worse My prediction is the choice they talk about each player having will disappear as soon as everyone works out which are the best or meta perks for each hero I dont have the time or focus to go over all of my worries but I wanna know what other peoples thoughts are Am I just overthinking things Is this just a preference thing Please be civil this is just my opinion based on nothing other than what was announced and my own feelings,Opinions on the introduction of perks I m not gon na lie I m kinda of dreading perks in the game One of my favourite things about overwatch is the fact that everyone is given the same kit for each hero and you have to get the best out of it with your skill Perks to me needlessly complicate a game that is probably already overwhelming for new players In addition the overwatch team has enough trouble balancing the cast as is perks are likely going to make balancing so much worse My prediction is the choice they talk about each player having will disappear as soon as everyone works out which are the best or meta perks for each hero I do nt have the time or focus to go over all of my worries but I wanna know what other peoples thoughts are Am I just overthinking things Is this just a preference thing Please be civil this is just my opinion based on nothing other than what was announced and my own feelings,opinion on the introduction of perk I m not go to lie I m kinda of dread perk in the game one of my favourite thing about overwatch be the fact that everyone be give the same kit for each hero and you have to get the good out of it with your skill Perks to I needlessly complicate a game that be probably already overwhelming for new player in addition the overwatch team have enough trouble balance the cast as be perk be likely go to make balance so much bad my prediction be the choice they talk about each player have will disappear as soon as everyone work out which be the good or meta perk for each hero I do not have the time or focus to go over all of my worry but I wanna know what other people thought be be I just overthinke thing be this just a preference thing please be civil this be just my opinion base on nothing other than what be announce and my own feeling,opinion introduction perk m lie m kinda dread perk game favourite thing overwatch fact kit hero good skill Perks needlessly complicate game probably overwhelming new player addition overwatch team trouble balance cast perk likely balance bad prediction choice talk player disappear soon work good meta perk hero time focus worry wanna know people thought overthinke thing preference thing civil opinion base announce feeling
Aaron Keller on Emonggs stream Stadium Hoping for 3rd Pillar of Overwatch with a full team around it with updates revolving and evolving features over time Bans hope to control ones gameplay He talks that Bans were tested 2 years ago but now that they see it happen Rivals probably that they had to added it now Hints that maybe updated Workshop one day huge huge vague maybe planned since Jeff days with full Editor But its hard to give everything Its a resource game at the end of the day Bans are for all Ranks Can hint what hero each player wants to play to avoid having your hero banned but any Hero can be banned regardless Everyone gives 3 weighted choices with priority on first Up to 4 per game 2 per role max Can 3rd person come to the whole game Dangerous question Easiest answer is to see Stadium reception References Rivals but says different game Ow is aim focused while Rivals is ability and melee focused Stadium is ability focused hence 3rd person made sense 3rd person was needed references Zarya bubbles 76 needs 3rd person to effectively know whats happening Genji can be in the air effectively the entire time in Stadium Core should be 1stbut are there options and opportunities to expand Winston Primal or Lucio Wallriding could be considered in 3rd person Could be a new 3rd person queue but apprehensive idea Aaron is interested in seeing what kind of playstyle and people arise from the 1st and 3rd shift to min max the game Game is open to perhaps being more risky now Aqua is a Support One of the coolest Primary Fires ever made Cinematics they want to get back to narrative and story Big set back on how they wanted to tell story So they had to refocus on how to do it Nothing to announce but hoping one day they can move the world state again after PvE didnt turn out as played Players want devs to take risks and innovation with crazy stuff PvE was a crazy risk but it didnt work out Promises failed But hope risks will be appreciated and payoff but things can go wrong but such challenges are inevitable Archives Completionists want it back but no answer when and if itll be back All new code and everything broke Archives so it has to be remade so its not necessarily worth making all over again Aaron is already a chad for mentioning PvE and Rivals lmao self insert Already planning for the S15refresh for 2026 now S9 was great as it did something fundamentally different for the game Clear goal to do it every year S9 didnt feel big enough to Aaron so they want to keep continue big changes TV show Aaron wants one too hes a fan it too But time and cost So Aaron doesnt decide such stuff Aaron Jeff was a pro being a director and hes awesome charismatic Aaron being in video is cringe But have to get used to it Aaron doesnt know if hell sit in front of a xmas fireplace But Aaron prefers to build a holiday stream where he builds a map like Atlantis Could do it every year OW engine is custom crafted for Overwatch and changes are difficult even 6v6 back Aaron No FOV slider in game First instinct was to be no FOV slider Theyd like to add the bottom left health stuff If Aaron could magic wand something in the game Hero Bans a month a go Weapon Variants but every hero is so distinct so doesnt want to totally reanimate heroes but to find ways to work with Heroes by keeping their identity but change what they can do without require major changes like cant ever change 76 having an Assault Rifle but having a different gun would be quite apparent Perks may not be as clear from a spectator perspective detail wise Weapon inspects launched OW2 without it People werent excited about a lot of new cosmetics so they had to prioritize but they might get to it as there was pushback Looltboxes S15 feature Why Game felt like people who dont spend makes the game less rewarding for them even tho its better with coins in BP but it lacks that small reward for recognizing people play the game They cannot be bought and theyll exist in the BP weekly play X amount of matches or play events Has ton of shop content of OW2 Stuff that isnt purchasable anymore in the shop anymore is going in the Loot Boxes Duplicate Protection So it rerolls the item thats the hope No one has all the items yet Button to open all Looltboxes and auto opens all looltboxes at the end of the season Giving away a ton of looltboxes in S15 Well over a 100 free

Worried perks will kill competitive Am I the only one worried that the massive diversity and change with the perks will kill the potential for OW 2 to become a truly competitive game I feel like a big part of what is required for that competitive aspect is consistency and balance If you look at successful eSports in the FPS realm Counter Strike and Valorant they dont have massive changes they dont include things that can completely shift the gameplay from game to game or even within the same game Potentially these changes will make it more fun as a casual experience What does everyone else think Am I being dramatic or is this a concern,Worried perks will kill competitive Am I the only one worried that the massive diversity and change with the perks will kill the potential for OW 2 to become a truly competitive game I feel like a big part of what is required for that competitive aspect is consistency and balance If you look at successful eSports in the FPS realm Counter Strike and Valorant they do nt have massive changes they do nt include things that can completely shift the gameplay from game to game or even within the same game Potentially these changes will make it more fun as a casual experience What does everyone else think Am I being dramatic or is this a concern,worried perk will kill competitive be I the only one worry that the massive diversity and change with the perk will kill the potential for OW 2 to become a truly competitive game I feel like a big part of what be require for that competitive aspect be consistency and balance if you look at successful eSports in the FPS realm Counter Strike and Valorant they do not have massive change they do not include thing that can completely shift the gameplay from game to game or even within the same game potentially these change will make it more fun as a casual experience what do everyone else think be I be dramatic or be this a concern,worried perk kill competitive worry massive diversity change perk kill potential OW 2 truly competitive game feel like big require competitive aspect consistency balance look successful eSports FPS realm Counter Strike Valorant massive change include thing completely shift gameplay game game game potentially change fun casual experience think dramatic concern
Stadium is awesome and healthy for the game Ive made postscomments here multiple times how the game needs a proper evolving Arcade mode and theyve added literally that which will be supported over time as a new identity to Overwatch Like events are cool but they just go away and then we didnt get any long lasting effect or improvement But now they can give new identity to Stadium every season And since theyre open to new modes also better than constantly adding core game modes before there are enough maps for them this allows them to add completely new ways to play An Overwatch style Battle Royale with upgrades through collecting perksmods can actually be possible one day So essentially Battle for Olympus but with more progression on like expanded Flashpoint maps where you level up Heroes but instead finding upgrades They can retool the item mechanic from PvE this way too or even as a crafting mechanic We can get a proper MOBA if they retool all the PvE engine changes especially if they learn from Deadlock Maps like Gothenburg could be used for it We can get a CoD Zombies like endless JunkensteinBride or at least a proper horde mode For example it wasnt justJunkensteins Lab but also the previous Trials of Sanctuary that helped build Stadium so PvE inclusion only makes sense eventually We can get a Risk of Rain 2 roguelite type mode perhaps like Warframe Duviri Paradox which could tell a small story or Warframe 1998 where Heroes have locked in different mod kits We can get a Le Sserafim type PvPvE mode something like Destinys Gambit This all just seems like what the game wanted to keep expanding towards something bigger Of course PvE didnt work but Aaron did mention that both theyre looking to expand how the game is played every year and also that theyre thinking about how to tell the story so a proper way of incorporating PvE or MMO concepts like Destiny could be a real possibility one day They clearly took their time to add perks and mods so if they do it realizing the expanded hope for Overwatch as an IP theyll take their time and test it out properly This isnt wishful thinking or hopium What Im saying is theyre building a live service the right way by testing and teasing content through live data and understanding what people like If they can truly make great PvE and MMO content they will take steps to try it the same way they did with perks even though many people were apprehensive at first about this too Theyre making it a fun and transparent process by including the playerbase as part of it and Trials Le Sserafim and Cosmic Crsis are examples they do want to do something with PvE Even bringing a sort of Archives or just using existing PvE with weekly modifiers could be fun enough as a test Think more of how Warframe has a small open world within its missionmode instead of entire regions This also adds on from the previous point Theyre adding new map variants for Stadium so who knows maybe Garden Warfare 2s mini open world as an expanded Practice Range could work Perhaps theyll take more from Rivals and add duotrio synergistic abilities too This really finally feels like an expansion to the game that Overwatch always needed the same way Fortnite Destiny Warframe would expand how to play the gamePvE was supposed to be that and it didnt work but they used its failing and production quite well to tool towards something that works Now theyre not killing the game to expand it but actually having players be part of that,Stadium is awesome and healthy for the game I ve made postscomments here multiple times how the game needs a proper evolving Arcade mode and they ve added literally that which will be supported over time as a new identity to Overwatch Like events are cool but they just go away and then we did nt get any long lasting effect or improvement But now they can give new identity to Stadium every season And since they re open to new modes also better than constantly adding core game modes before there are enough maps for them this allows them to add completely new ways to play An Overwatch style Battle Royale with upgrades through collecting perksmods can actually be possible one day So essentially Battle for Olympus but with more progression on like expanded Flashpoint maps where you level up Heroes but instead finding upgrades They can retool the item mechanic from PvE this way too or even as a crafting mechanic We can get a proper MOBA if they retool all the PvE engine changes especially if they learn from Deadlock Maps like Gothenburg could be used for it We can get a CoD Zombies like endless JunkensteinBride or at least a proper horde mode For example it was nt justJunkensteins Lab but also the previous Trials of Sanctuary that helped build Stadium so PvE inclusion only makes sense eventually We can get a Risk of Rain 2 roguelite type mode perhaps like Warframe Duviri Paradox which could tell a small story or Warframe 1998 where Heroes have locked in different mod kits We can get a Le Sserafim type PvPvE mode something like Destinys Gambit This all just seems like what the game wanted to keep expanding towards something bigger Of course PvE did nt work but Aaron did mention that both they re looking to expand how the game is played every year and also that they re thinking about how to tell the story so a proper way of incorporating PvE or MMO concepts like Destiny could be a real possibility one day They clearly took their time to add perks and mods so if they do it realizing the expanded hope for Overwatch as an IP they ll take their time and test it out properly This is nt wishful thinking or hopium What I m saying is they re building a live service the right way by testing and teasing content through live data and understanding what people like If they can truly make great PvE and MMO content they will take steps to try it the same way they did with perks even though many people were apprehensive at first about this too They re making it a fun and transparent process by including the playerbase as part of it and Trials Le Sserafim and Cosmic Crsis are examples they do want to do something with

Gavin with Emongg Should win rates be visible Potentially Gameplay engineers have been working on Stadium for years FOV on Console Some tech difficulty Not that they dont want to do it but its just difficult PC game has to have FOV sliders duh Total Mayhem and Mystery Heroes maylikely not have Perks Smurf changes going well Play againsts bot first few times so instantly gauge how well someone does Some people sell bots and so cheaters trial matches and ALWAYS lose those matches But that makes it very obvious when cheaters are always losing to bots and doing no damage Gavin Wasis working on Rank Portraits update Charms are in s15 patch but dont display till s16 April Fools will be funnyyyy Gothenburg map Originally 2CP Its cursed No work is being done one it Unlucky history Clash There is a plan But it could be another Assault 2CP And if Clash doesnt work they WILL cut it and just give up on it but they hope they dont have to cut it One of the maps in Stadium is inside the arena seen from Colloseo Stadium Mercy Rule auto win when team goes 30 like whitewash I believe Takes away from the 34 reverse sweep but dont want to sour the experience due to how unlikely it is like playing vs 4 stack They want to add health bar UI but it took too much space so theyre thinking about it But a lot of time went into Stadium UI like every perk has unique design Maps are specific to Stadium So even if KOTH round instead of adding to Control Making Progression system more front and center But not a priority but in the pipeline Map voting No commitment to specifics 3 maps to vote from Role a die 1 in 10 chance an unlikely role may happen There is a chance Kings Row can be played 3 times in a row The way it works is 2 of 3 maps are least maps played but 3rd is completely random But of course its chosen from the pool of all 10 players so quite random Other players highlight is cool Rivals but theyre working on cooler features Rehaul of Top 500 Gavin personally wants to do But resources Cooler things takes predecence but top 500 is too niche to focus on Gavin talked wacky idea to management and stuff about something he didnt elaborate on lol Dangerous from a social perspective not a design one Target bans Dangerous at streamer level if someone joins stream and notice Emongg is also on Ilios Banned Heroes are banned for everyone Just for clarity Gavin mentions they have a cool game Rivals Chat says competition is good for consumer Gavin is Role queue stan Gavin wasnt supposed to play employee beta as he didnt work there yet lmao Rivals is open queue so he doesnt like Rivals but Gavin says they have some really cool characters Gavins peak Masters Only played group throw games by design wants it to happen doesnt enjoy playing alone so answer is Plat to Diamond Gold is high rank of course GavinEmongg Playing with friends is underrated and enjoyable Surrender option as a 5 stack could be added But only building for niche audience is not happening Good enough option to add it when someone wants to surrender but their team then actually wins and it feels rewarding #Moira rework failed Reaper may still be considered but isnt actively being looked at Map votes arent about modes essentially just to give more options 3rd to 1st pov May open a new playstyle MMR reset Never Slightly harder than last soft reset Emongg 3rd person feels good Only wants to keep playing it to get a feel Map voting is comp only Could be following a DPS Support Tank order But too early to tell Stadium will only be comp not fully sure if I heard that right Gavin likes cereal and yogurt parfaits Cinnamon roll hot or miss Favorite heroes to Bans might be added Share or recommend builds Not considered yet Gavin didnt comment when Emongg answered about flamethrower considering its probably the most demanded hero type to the game for years Then again they did fail to add it with Mauga and Ball CoD Zombies Zomnics for rating appropriate A lot of people in the team likes it but no plans right now Gavin likes Mauga due to Heavy in TF2 Hes part of the problem They Mauga criticisms are valid Stadium first possibly could expand into Roguelite But its taking a long time Having to flesh out eat Hero first Wanted to make cosmic weapon skins without making it distracting like the movement of the stars with the new Galactic Weapons Colorblind players cant see versus Gold and Jade But it is what it is Its not just color this time but more to it 6v6 is limited time Gavin makes no such decision But its a test to see if it draws an audience Cuz criticism was it wasnt taken seriously due to no competitive mode so if people truly want to play the game more with 6v6 then that may be the way to work on it Stadium wont be as sweaty as current comp Dont know if collabs skins in Lootboxes Stadium was worked on at least a year for sure Plan is to add more Heroes to Stadium upon launch Destiny GambitPvPvE isnt the direction for Stadium Workshop Maybe keep requesting it If Gavin would instantly add a feature World Peace x Overwatch Gavin did scoreboard ping system comp Hes a spectator to this stuff But Stadium changes took years Clash didnt fail Hard problem was what to do with the final point If too easy too short OR too hard then no point to cap Could just change point entirely Maybe change to Round mode like beating map is just one point but that leads to variable game time But its really variable on when to attack AE how many times to keep attacking and its all just very unintuitive Problem with TF2 back cap was what Jeff said is they try not to give multiple objectives at same times as team can disagree on what to do when they cant even agree on the win condition so giving 2 win conditions is a really scary thing to add making the team really frustrating TF2 had bigger team sizes so it worked for TF2 Clash just has difficult game design problems Unlikely for 2CP to come back If no one wants to vote for maps then maybe they dont need to be in the pool in the first place big picture questions 2CP maybe fixable But too hard due to chokes Gavin didnt want to do hero Bans due to toxicity between team mates But he may be too focused on the bad than the good Should you chase something that could fail Before Rivals even came out they were talking about Bans due to OWCS Gavins dream game mode not sure how often he wants to add new game modes Stadium is a metamode Not aware of Paris being a full Push map Gavin Fav Escort or Flashpoint The classic vs strategic Hope to make improved maps like for Push and Flashpoint No idea why Juno and Hazard dont have Steam achievements Gavin really wants to add Advanced Hero Info But surprisingly taking a lot of time As Heroes are setup in scripts But they dont want to keep having to update script for every change So Gavin is taking game data from script and linking it to the UI Engineers are doing that But its like making a thread between script and UI Need to show many things but need to show a lot of system information one to one so its not easy Jetpack cat and animal heroes Nothing to say about that Gavin likes Mama Hong Funny character Gavin is aware of rEmreMains and that theres a streamer mode named after him This was Mirandas joke MacaroniGlove streamer mode name Moira Mythic Mauga was in dev before Gavin joined Gavin does not know why flamethrower failed for Ball and Mauga Gavin likes to play everything Most played is Ana Fav design is Ramattra Gunblade Illari wasnt made from a gunblade design perspective but just to look cool But Gavin understands why players may want that fantasy considering she does have a gunblade Venture wasnt a solution to Doom Tank It opened up a hero focused on abilities Alex made Venture Pyra Not sure of spelling made Illari hero design concept and abilities for Venture and Illari Bot fill in for a leaver Cursed problem They could But too much variability across Ranks but could be added for Quick Play Freja is a projectile Hero Both primary and secondary Gavin knows nothing about Spotlight being an alternate to Blizzcon No alien Heroes as the story is futuristic but about humans Rank is not MMR If Rank was MMR and someone was Bronze it would be really bad for Overwatch As since its not one can level up faster This is to reduce fakeness of matches Hero trials Win rates by rank region platforms Then look at damage and death at each rank LW had one of the lowest death rates but also one of the lowest win rates but his up time wasnt changing the outcome And they learned a lot from Lifeweaver And that is why we have Hero Trials Rank inflation up when not normally go up and have to decide if that is wanted to be in system No plan to add rank below Bronze Because it isnt a good feeling Master GM Champion will more people pushed in it But Gavin isnt convinced as many people will be in Champion But queue time issues particularly Champion one Bronze could get more divisions But they want to make B4 and B5 a smaller part of the pool Arcade as one pool is a cool idea but that is not easy to do and would take a long time Revealing player count of Arcade in dead mode could be interesting But no mode is dead but some modes may be less populated at certain times Server selector Gavin isnt against it But not his expertise Giving player choice can lead to them making a bad decision Its not an easy feature Need to put in warnings Quick Play MMR doesnt reset with Rank reset Heroes with 2 forms are the hardest like CloakDagger DVa Ram They arent against it CD are actually 2 different characters but Gavin says that is what Ram is that same concept Gavin would like an Overwatch show too working in game dev Working in submarine should be same as spaceship cuz you cant breathe outside anyways Invasion event people liked the lore but the gameplay was questionable Gavin didnt worked on PvE so cant say much April Fools 2025 has real effort into it Really dumb Cannot swap Perks But 3rd round in comp may allow it Gavin says Post Game cards are cool but not actively being worked on didnt get time to rebuild for OW2 but theyd be done differently Quick Play is generally most played Comp can sometimes surpass it like during Comp Reset Arcade rarely unless like Junkenstein Labs If you cancel long queue and requeue and find a game it may have been a bug Gavin is really interested in bans for what was shown Reworks of Survasa and NJC 3rd person peaking Is a question for Stadium designers More than 3 heroes a year Prioritizing quality Marvel movie Gavin likes Winter Solider Iron Man 1 Guardians movies Dr Strange portal for Sym is too heavy on the game And if someone knew they had a tech advantage somehow it would be exploited Gavin is a perfectionist Wishes there were fewer draws in hybrid Nit pick If team had 3 times as people could add Hero every season joke Cant swap Heroes in Stadium Clash in Stadium could work as a Round based Clash game mode Jetpack Cat is a Hero

take predecence but top 500 be too niche to focus on Gavin talk wacky idea to management and stuff about something he do not elaborate on lol dangerous from a social perspective not a design one Target ban dangerous at streamer level if someone join stream and notice Emongg be also on Ilios Banned Heroes be ban for everyone just for clarity Gavin mention they have a cool game rival Chat say competition be good for consumer Gavin be Role queue stan Gavin be not suppose to play employee beta as he do not work there yet lmao Rivals be open queue so he do not like rival but Gavin say they have some really cool character gavin peak Masters only play group throw game by design want it to happen do not enjoy play alone so answer be Plat to Diamond Gold be high rank of course GavinEmongg Playing with friend be underrated and enjoyable surrender option as a 5 stack could be add but only build for niche audience be not happen good enough option to add it when someone want to surrender but their team then actually win and it feels reward Moira rework fail Reaper may still be consider but be not actively be look at Map vote be not about mode essentially just to give more option 3rd to 1st pov may open a new playstyle MMR reset never slightly hard than last soft reset Emongg 3rd person feel good only want to keep play it to get a feel Map voting be comp only could be follow a DPS Support Tank order but too early to tell Stadium will only be comp not fully sure if I hear that right Gavin like cereal and yogurt parfait Cinnamon roll hot or miss favorite hero to Bans might be add Share or recommend build not consider yet Gavin do not comment when Emongg answer about flamethrower consider its probably the most demand hero type to the game for year then again they do fail to add it with Mauga and Ball CoD Zombies Zomnics for rate appropriate a lot of people in the team like it but no plan right now Gavin like Mauga due to Heavy in TF2 he s part of the problem they Mauga criticism be valid Stadium first possibly could expand into Roguelite but its take a long time have to flesh out eat Hero first want to make cosmic weapon skin without make it distract like the movement of the star with the new Galactic Weapons Colorblind player can not see versus Gold and Jade but it be what it be its not just color this time but more to it 6v6 be limited time Gavin make no such decision but its a test to see if it draw an audience cuz criticism be it be not take seriously due to no competitive mode so if people truly want to play the game more with 6v6 then that may be the way to work on it Stadium will not be as sweaty as current comp do not know if collab skin in Lootboxes Stadium be work on at least a year for sure Plan be to add more Heroes to Stadium upon launch Destiny GambitPvPvE be not the direction for Stadium Workshop maybe keep request it if Gavin would instantly add a feature World Peace x Overwatch Gavin do scoreboard ping system comp he s a spectator to this stuff but Stadium change take year Clash do not fail hard problem be what to do with the final point if too easy too short or too hard then no point to cap could just change point entirely maybe change to Round mode like beat map be just one point but that lead to variable game time but its really variable on when to attack AE how many time to keep attack and its all just very unintuitive problem with TF2 back cap be what Jeff say be they try not to give multiple objective at same time as team can disagree on what to do when they can not even agree on the win condition so give 2 win condition be a really scary thing to add make the team really frustrating TF2 have big team size so it work for TF2 Clash just have difficult game design problem unlikely for 2cp to come back if no one want to vote for map then maybe they do not need to be in the pool in the first place big picture question 2cp maybe fixable but too hard due to choke Gavin do not want to do hero ban due to toxicity between team mate but he may be too focused on the bad than the good should you chase something that could fail before rival even come out they be talk about ban due to OWCS Gavins dream game mode not sure how often he want to add new game mode Stadium be a metamode not aware of Paris be a full push map Gavin Fav Escort or Flashpoint the classic vs strategic Hope to make improved map like for Push and Flashpoint no idea why Juno and Hazard do not have Steam achievement Gavin really want to add advanced Hero Info but surprisingly take a lot of time as Heroes be setup in script but they do not want to keep have to update script for every change so Gavin be take game datum from script and link it to the UI Engineers be do that but its like make a thread between script and UI need to show many thing but need to show a lot of system information one to one so its not easy Jetpack cat and animal hero nothing to say about that Gavin like Mama Hong Funny character Gavin be aware of remremain and that there s a streamer mode name after he this be Mirandas joke MacaroniGlove streamer mode name Moira Mythic Mauga be in dev before Gavin join Gavin do not know why flamethrower fail for Ball and Mauga Gavin like to play everything most play be Ana Fav design be Ramattra Gunblade Illari be not make from a gunblade design perspective but just to look cool but Gavin understand why player may want that fantasy consider she do have a gunblade Venture be not a solution to Doom Tank it open up a hero focus on ability Alex make Venture Pyra not sure of spelling make Illari hero design concept and ability for Venture and Illari Bot fill in for a leaver Cursed problem they could but too much variability across Ranks but could be add for Quick Play Freja be a projectile Hero both primary and secondary Gavin know nothing about Spotlight be an alternate to Blizzcon no alien Heroes as the story be futuristic but about human Rank be not MMR if Rank be MMR and someone be Bronze it would be really bad for overwatch as since its not one can level up fast this be to reduce fakeness of match Hero trial win rate by rank region platform then look at damage and death at each rank LW have one of the low death rate but also one of the low win rate but his up time be not change the outcome and they learn a lot from Lifeweaver and that be why we have Hero Trials Rank inflation up when not normally go up and have to decide if that be want to be in system no plan to add rank below Bronze because it be not a good feeling Master GM Champion will more people push in it but Gavin be not convince as many people will be in Champion but queue time issue particularly Champion one Bronze could get more division but they want to make B4 and B5 a small part of the pool Arcade as one pool be a cool idea but that be not easy to do and would take a long time reveal player count of Arcade in dead mode could be interesting but no mode be dead but some mode may be less populated at certain time Server selector Gavin be not against it but not his expertise give player choice can lead to they make a bad decision its not an easy feature need to put in warning Quick Play MMR do not reset with Rank reset Heroes with 2 form be the hard like CloakDagger dva Ram they be not against it CD be actually 2 different character but Gavin say that be what Ram be that same concept Gavin would like an Overwatch show too work in game dev work in submarine should be same as spaceship cuz you can not breathe outside anyways Invasion event people like the lore but the gameplay be questionable Gavin do not work on PvE so can not say much April Fools 2025 have real effort into it really dumb can not swap Perks but 3rd round in comp may allow it Gavin say Post Game card be cool but not actively be work on do not get time to rebuild for OW2 but they d be do differently Quick play be generally most play Comp can sometimes surpass it like during Comp Reset Arcade rarely unless like Junkenstein Labs if you cancel long queue and requeue and find a game it may have be a bug Gavin be really interested in ban for what be show Reworks of Survasa and NJC 3rd person peak be a question for Stadium designer More than 3 hero a year prioritize quality Marvel movie Gavin like Winter Solider Iron Man 1 Guardians movie Dr Strange portal for Sym be too heavy on the game and if someone know they have a tech advantage somehow it would be exploit Gavin be a perfectionist Wishes there be few draw in hybrid Nit pick if team have 3 time as people could add Hero every season joke can not swap Heroes in Stadium Clash in Stadium could work as a Round base Clash game mode Jetpack Cat be a Hero Juno headshot heal could be but it make it awkward for DVa or Winston no

Despite literally everything Im still holding out for even a crumb of PvE news I KNOW that it was all run into the ground for years the entire PvE team got fired theyve been reusing assets literally everywhere but for whatever inexplicable reason I still believe theres a non0 chance something will happen This chance is still 1 but its something Blizzard said that their PvE release schedule was releasing a few missions every 18 months Aside from just how shit that release schedule is that means that since Invasion was released in August 2023 we still have until the end of February for literally anything No expectations whatsoever they didnt even utter the name in the Spotlight and once March 1st comes along I can just lay it all to rest and finally move on But Blizzard COME ON These skill trees youre adding perks or whatever thats literally all we weve been waiting for Just take your Invasion missions make them free since no one is buying them anyway rerelease that one free Kings Row missions from Season 6 then just add some perks and maybe some challenges from the old Archives missions I dont remember all 9 challenges but I remember Molten Cores Enemies drop Molten Core puddles upon death Glass Cannon Player health is much lower but damage is much higher lets say 40 health but 300 damage just as an example Invincible Barriers Come on now Critical Strikes Only headshots can deal damage Storm Raging Certain enemies spawn nanoboosted and killing those enemies will cause other nearby enemies to also become nanoboosted Blood Moon Rising Enemies have very high lifesteal on all attacks Thunderstorm Lightning will periodically follow a player around and strike the area theyre standing like a mini Doomfist ult Like come on just rerecycle what youve already got take the PvE missions add perks and some small challenges this could be done in a weekend,Despite literally everything I m still holding out for even a crumb of PvE news I KNOW that it was all run

Most of the perks are fillers and straight buffs that do not need to exist Only a handful of perks are fun and meaningful but I think it wouldve been better if those perks were reworks instead of perks Just for context I was very excited when I was watching Aaron Keller introduce torbs spider turret and turret upgrade but then I spent some time to read through all the perks and my dream was shattered Like seriously how is giving lucio 30 more knock back interesting in any way shape or form How is giving Meis secondary fire a slow going to achieve anything other than just making her blatantly stronger Isnt 1 extra sec on moira fade a literally number tweak that belongs to patch notes Most of these perks dont even open up new playstyles They are just plain buffs that raise the power level of the game changing the overall feeling of the game without a reason We players fell in love with this game because of its identity and uniqueness How is changing the power level an essential part of the games identity going to do any good What is the vision here I dont see Despite my overhelming dread and terror toward the perks system some perks are actually very interesting For example soldiers stim pack sharing the cooldown of healing station and giving soldier himself an antiheal is so interesting and nuanced with so much risk reward and decision making You actually get to change the way you approach this game by choosing between stim packs and healing station How is this supposed to exist in the same system with 3sec off combat roll cd for every headshot For another example mercys flash heal is a type of utility with choices and decision making which is crucial if they ever want to make people beside onetricks to ever want to play mercy And people are supposed to choose between this and that braindead second dmg boost Just to make it clear I am not mad at Blizzard I do not know what this perk system is going to do to the game Nobody knows I am just afraid that this will not work out and overwatch wont be overwatch anymore Ive never felt so worried about this game before I did not even criticize s9 changes when it came out Besides my fear I am also frustrated that all those nuanced complicated ideas are shoved into the same category with stronger coach gun and bigger pulse bomb,Most of the perks are fillers and straight buffs that do not

The perk system seems anti competitive at its core In a competitive team based shooter ability consistency matters a ton and yet this perk inclusion seems to fundamentally undermine the competitive aspect of what overwatch should be and has been historically Its literally doubling down on making the game more casually cod like and less about the integrity of a competitive shooter Im not saying balance is more important than fun Im saying that a first fight shouldnt ever be decided because you are having to guess which ability the enemy chose when engaging,The perk system seems anti competitive at its core In a competitive team based shooter ability consistency matters a ton and yet this perk inclusion seems to fundamentally undermine the competitive aspect of what overwatch should be and has been historically Its literally doubling down on making the game more casually cod like and less about the integrity of a competitive shooter I m not saying balance is more important than fun I m saying that a first fight should nt ever be decided because you are having to guess which ability the enemy chose when engaging,the perk system seem anti competitive at its core in a competitive team base shooter ability consistency matter a ton and yet this perk inclusion seem to fundamentally undermine the competitive aspect of what overwatch should be and have be historically its literally double down on make the game more casually cod like and less about the integrity of a competitive shooter I m not say balance be more important than fun I m say that a first fight should not ever be decide because you be have to guess which ability the enemy choose when engage,perk system anti competitive core competitive team base shooter ability consistency matter ton perk inclusion fundamentally undermine competitive aspect overwatch historically literally double game casually cod like integrity competitive shooter m balance important fun m fight decide guess ability enemy choose engage

Hero ban details from Spilos interview with Gavin Winter All points are taken from Spilos video available on YouTube here starts at 4500 Wanted to prioritize speed with hero bans ban phase is only 1 round between 2030 seconds Currently both teams will get two bans each Each player will get to pick up to three characters they want to ban ordered from highest to lowest priority Once the ban phase is complete the game will calculate which heroes to ban for each team based on the vote totals Max of 4 heroes banned total Dont expect there to be too many ties in voting but they do have tiebreaker systems in place just in case Working on a system where players can show their preferred heroes to their team before the ban phase seems similar to the preselect phase in Marvel Rivals Opportunity to tell your team what you want to play Gavin jokes If you tell your team that you want to play a hero thats considered very weak maybe theyll ban your hero to stop you from playing it Both teams cant ban the same hero If this happens the game counts the team that voted for that hero more as the team that banned that hero and select the next highest heroes from the other team Gavin says theres actually a complex order of operations going on behind the scene but the ban selections happen instantly for the players Voice and text chat are enabled during the ban phase We dont think theres a way to game the system weve thought about it a lot Reiterates the system is still inprogress You will see the map first before deciding bans You will NOT be able to see who is on the enemy team during the ban phase Gavin says this was done specifically to avoid the issue of target banning Gavin on target banning I think hero bans should punch up at the strong things and they should not punch down and a lot of targeted bans would punch down Wants people to ban the strong or annoying heroes and not simply target OTPs You dont have to choose 3 heroes to ban you can choose anything between 0 and 3 It is possible for less than 4 heroes to be banned in a match simply if not enough players vote Hero bans will be implemented at every rank and will be exclusive to comp Gavin says they dont really have an argument for why they should deny bans to lower ranks If the bronze players are going to be wrong let them be wrong Team is going to be looking at ban data and which heroes get banned from a variety of angles including region platform and rank I think there will be situations where people ban bad heroes that are annoying and I think those people will probably drop in rank in some cases Spilo jokes but would you prefer to be low rank and enjoy the experience One of the things they didnt realize about bans early on that they do now is just novelty it makes games different and more unique Slightly worried about ban metas but thinks theyre much less likely that previously thought Will be listening to player feedback on the system Great perk of using a ranked choice system is that they can change things behind the scenes without having to overhaul the UI Gavin Excited for the rules Ive written but sure Ill be wrong about something Gavin notes someone in chat saying that characters will be banned based on map alone says thats a great point and a reason why they will show the map before bans start Says that hero winrates differ by 10 based on the map Currently theres a cap of 2 heroes banned per role Gavin says this is to prevent 4 heroes in the Support and Tank cast specifically being banned since those pools are smaller If more than 2 heroes of the same role are in the top ban picks the top 2 get banned and the rest are skipped moving on to the next highest voted characters from different roles Bans section ends there after that they move on to competitive rewards,Hero

Perks seem amazingly cool but might be a balancing nightmare I like many others am super excited for the new perks But Im a little skeptical balancing wise Certain heros in the game right now Id argue are pretty unhealthy for the game Mauga and giving them additional abilities or buffs might just make them less fun to against So Id say some heros will need serious reworks But otherwise Im excited for the perks since its almost like discovering the game for the first time again trying to figure out what everyone can do and choosing what suits your play style best,Perks seem amazingly cool but might be a balancing nightmare I like many others am super excited for the new perks But I m a little skeptical balancing wise Certain heros in the game right now I d argue are pretty unhealthy for the game Mauga and giving them additional abilities or buffs might just make them less fun to against So I d say some heros will need serious reworks But otherwise I m excited for the perks since its almost like discovering the game for the first time again trying to figure out what everyone can do and choosing what suits your play style best,perk seem amazingly cool but might be a balancing nightmare I like many other be super excited for the new perk but I m a little skeptical balance wise certain hero in the game right now I d argue be pretty unhealthy for the game Mauga and give they additional ability or buff might just make they less fun to against so I d say some hero will need serious rework but otherwise I m excited for the perk since its almost like discover the game for the first time again try to figure out what everyone can do and choose what suit your play style well,perk amazingly cool balancing nightmare like super excited new perk m little skeptical balance wise certain hero game right d argue pretty unhealthy game Mauga additional ability buff fun d hero need rework m excited perk like discover game time try figure choose suit play style
MMW Perk system is going to worsen counterpicking so much that many matchup will go from 64 to 73 Imagine youre on Dva playing into Zarya Lets say both of you reaches level 2 at the same time Which is already a stretch because Zarya is probably going to be way faster Zarya is going to gain verticality so Dva can no longer avoid Zaryas beam by hiding on high grounds Meanwhile both of Dvas perks have zero impact before demach This is going to snowball and result in the team with Zarya rolling over the team with Dva Sure Dva can swap but then she is just giving up the entire first point She can swap after the first or second teamfight but then she would be giving up both ult charge and level It is an extreme case but it is generally true among all the counters Bastion gets more mobility

Some perk replacementchange ideas Obviously without playing around with Perks its very hard to judge their effectiveness but for fun I came up with a few that I think would enhance the playstyle of these heroes without going over the power limit of the rest of them I tried to target ones that looked less interesting or engaging and choose to ignore ones that seem too powerful # Dva Minor Perks Bunny Stomp Landing from falling deals up to 60 damage around Dva and Call Mechs damage radius is increased by 50 percent Replaces Ejection Suit Pilot Dva gains 2 abilities Slide and Big Shot from Heroes of the Storm # Doomfist Major Perks Replaces Seismic Empowerment Doomfist gains Uppercut he can activate with reload but the duration of Power Block is decreased Seismic Slam travel distance is reduced and cooldown is increased by 1 second and gaining empowered punch now only resets Rocket Punchs cooldown # Ashe Minor Perks Replaces Sidewinder While BOB is active use ultimate to command him to reposition to a targeted area if he collides with an enemy while repositioning he knocks them back and deals 60 damage # Cassidy Major Perks Replaces Quick Draw Flashbang is replaced by a slightly

of Mei while walking forward increases her movement speed by up to 30 over 3 seconds but if she stops she will continue to slide Major Perks Replaces Biting Cold Meis CyroFreeze now forms a ball around her and she will be able to move at a slower rate # Sombra Minor Perks CTRL ALT ESC Teleporting with Translocator reduces the cooldown of passive health regeneration by 50 or activates it if

back at any time cooldown starts when teleporting back Additionally Sombra can now enter Stealth by crouching for 3 seconds # Venture Major Perks Replaces Covered in Dirt Hold RMB to charge Drill Dash greatly increasing the distance Venture is launched but the ability only deals damage and knocks back enemies for the abilitys original duration # Widowmaker Major Perks Deadly Deux Enemies hit by Venom Mine have their hitboxes increased against Widowmaker only and Venom Mine gains a second charge enabling two active mines at a time # Brigitte Minor Perks Replaces Morale Boost Enemies hit by Whip Shot are hindered until they land or up to 1 second Major Perks Replaces Quick Fix While Inspire and Repair Pack are both active on a target 50 of overhealing is converted to overhealth by up to

Perks look like they have the chance to hit on so many cylinders From a content perspective theres so much new that comes with this and in my opinion this looks like the excitingbig change people wanted to see when you slap a 2 next to a hit game On release ow2 felt more like a reconfiguration of a known classic trying to cut down on some features that introduced difficult problems instead of adding more bulk to the game and building on itself We obviously havent been able to test out perks yet but part of what made overwatch feel so special were the abilities and the fantasies behind them and im excited to see them lean into that direction more through this new mechanic I feel like weve all had moments where weve fantasized about excitingwackycreative mechanics being added to certain heros and though some fantasies may never come true the devs have clearly shown their willingness for bolder ideas like sticky torb turrets or flying zenyatta Adding abilities that are fun for the sake of fun feels like such a reward to fans who want to see certain heros unlock their true potential like letting illari go super sayin blue or orisa dropping like a rock while entering fortify mid air and squishing those around her They probably do that stuff in the in game universe And its just really neat to see it iterated on through gameplay Maybe theyll add level 5 perks one day where doomfist can actually punch buildings off the map just like in cannon Besides the fantasy aspect i think perks especially minor ones will provide a helpful nudge to players who might need only a couple tweaks to improve their performancein game experience In addition i think it could allow the devs to rotate in and out new hero mechanics easier providing another avenue of new content while letting characters maintain a core kitidentity Now when having discussions on reworking characters we might find the solution is slapping on a new perk option instead of needing to uproot so much of their original identity which imo sounds a lot better than questioning which parts of kits should go in the trash,Perks look like they have the chance to hit on so many cylinders From a content

Seeing the amount of content in Stadium really shows how much PvE content was made but scrapped This is not a negative post its really exciting seeing all the cool stuff from the Spotlight event especially the new Stadium content But it just really visualises how much content that was probably made for PvE was actually made before it was scrapped Looking at the streams showing the early content were seeing all these really wide ranging perks and powers maps being reworked for Stadium ie the new Busan control and Paris push and it makes me think how much of this was actually made from scratch vs how much of this was old PvE stuff they were able to dust off and repurpose for PvP and how much more stuff might there be Either way so exciting to see really positive new things happening with OW2 and its good to have that feeling of hope back again,Seeing the amount of content in Stadium really shows how much PvE content was made but scrapped This is not a negative post its really exciting seeing all the cool stuff from the Spotlight event especially the new Stadium content But it just really visualises how much content that was probably made for PvE was actually made before it was scrapped Looking at the streams showing the early content were seeing all these really wide ranging perks and powers maps being reworked for Stadium ie the new Busan control and Paris push and it makes me think how much of this was actually made from scratch vs how much of this was old PvE stuff they were able to dust off and repurpose for PvP and how much more stuff might there be Either way so exciting to see really positive new things happening with OW2 and its good to have that feeling of hope back again,see the amount of content in Stadium really show how much pve content be make but scrap this be not a negative post its really exciting see all the cool stuff from the Spotlight event especially the new Stadium content but it just really visualise how much content that be probably make for PvE be actually make before it be scrap look at the stream show the early content be see all these really wide range perk and power map be rework for Stadium ie the new Busan control and Paris push and it make I think how much of this be actually make from scratch vs how much of this be old pve stuff they be able to dust off and repurpose for PvP and how much more stuff might there be either way so exciting to see really positive new thing happen with OW2 and its good to have that feeling of hope back again,content Stadium pve content scrap negative post exciting cool stuff Spotlight event especially new Stadium content visualise content probably PvE actually scrap look stream early content wide range perk power map rework Stadium ie new Busan control Paris push think actually scratch vs old pve stuff able dust repurpose PvP stuff way exciting positive new thing happen OW2 good feeling hope
If Archives missions are never coming back can devs allow players to remake them in Workshop In the interview Aaron Keller had with Emongg it was stated that the Overwatch Archives Missions wouldnt be coming back It was because theyd need to redesign them for the OW2 engine and its not worth their time to do that I know a lot of people hated the modes but there were a lot who looked forward to playing them every year when they came back for a few weeks So if the devs have no intention of doing it can they let the players do it You can already do bot spawns in workshop for the zombie mode games except I think for now its just the training range bots iirc and a lot of the assets needed to make a PvE experience like opening doors and the different enemy types are already in OW2 from the SojournTorbLucio PvE missions The only thing that would be different is allowing the players to utilize voice lines from the archives missions in workshop So could that happen Itd be janky of course and it wouldnt have the same 100 feel as the original archives missions But I think a lot of people would appreciate option being made available in one way or another Plus playersworkshop editors could make new missions or even build on the old archives missions if theyre able to let the players choose perks or other mods For all I know its been doable for some time now and the people who are

Its Time to Bring Back Uppercut For background Ive been playing Overwatch since 2016or17 but I have not logged on to the game in months That being said I could not help but check out the new changes they are going to be implementing in Season 15 and Season 16 And I am impressed Passives seem like an amazing idea and balancing issues aside ultimately what people want is a funtoplay game which sometimes means you have to introduce some crazy stuff So it makes complete sense that they went all out with the passives But why not for Doomfist And before everyone starts screaming and pointing fingers no this is not some secret conspiracy to undermine the Doomfist players and its childish to think so The point of this essay isnt to trash on the devs for refusing to bring Uppercut back but it is to make some noise due to the fact that it wasnt That being said I think we have run out of excuses to not bring back the move because we have a whole list of abilitiestraits that were removed that are coming back to the game Orisa Shield Rock stun scaling Lifeweaver drop Selfrepair Tank form Swift Strike Bleed and arguably double jump reset if we stretch it Scatter Arrow Reaper Soul Globes Angelic Recovery You cannot tell me with all the crazy abilities being brought back going as far as Orisa shieldScatterLiterally everything for Bastion that we cant make an extension for Uppercut as well The only question left is how Because now that Doomfist is in the tank role this would be a difficult task Here are possible Major Perks OutofBlock Options Reinputting Power Block allows you to perform an Uppercut now cancelled by LMB Slightly raises its cooldown Rise to Power Empowered fist changes Power Block into an Uppercut Does not cancel Power Block but allows you to reinput once again AllIn Replace Power Block with an Uppercut that grants bonus overhealth and avoids stuns Hitting 2 or more enemies Empowers Rocket Punch This form of Rising Uppercut would be very low damage but extra AoE Grants immediate overhealth onuse as well During the Uppercut Doomfist gains CC immunity These are all ideas that allow Uppercut to be reintroduced while allowing for Doomfist to excel in his role as a Tank Admittedly the last idea wasnt thought through very thouroughly but these only serve as examples of what can be done Let me know what you guys think and be sure to spread the word if you agree,Its Time to Bring Back Uppercut For background I ve been playing Overwatch since 2016or17 but I have not logged on to the game in months That being said I could not help but check out the new

Perks in comp Id love to get a civil discussion going about the perks being in competitive off day one Ive seen a lot of posts about the perks and people seem very divided on it Some people hate it and some people love it I can see both sides but Id like to spark an objective discussion about its place in competitive Here are my thoughts for starters I wish theyd take things slow I get that regardless of which you prefer MR is posing some competition right now and OW has to cook something big But as a long time overwatch and competitive player I was already stoked for map voting and hero bans I really think theyre good additions for competitive and can handle some counter swapping and frustrating issues in the game Nobody has to versus widow anymore I as tracer no longer have to deal with turrets and nobody needs to fight orisa for example Simultaneously we wont have annoying map metas like widow on circuit royale I wish theyd test this first Just this change I think its really healthy for competitive The perks on the other hand seems to be too all in if you catch my drift I feel like its too disruptive Im not against the idea of the perks system I loved junks lab but Im just against the idea of it immediately being added into comp In my opinion it seems really difficult to balance And some advocate for the everyone is op outlook like in MR where everyone has some busted ability but imo one of the things I loved about overwatch was this lack of randomness that comes from everything being OP The game feels way more grounded when you can basically play around everything because the abilities are not TOO strong It also takes away from some of the rankedness of ranked I have no idea how to describe this but basically Ive been playing overwatch for years and years and every season I push for a better rank I dont want handouts from Tracer being super strong with her major perk and I dont want snowball games from some enemies farming perks off winning the first few fights I want to improve at the game I feel like this reduces the competitiveness of the games Of course I could be completely and utterly wrong Admittedly Im generally opposed to change This could be a blast and revitalise the game for all I know But then again it cant hurt to just leave it as an arcade mode and if its really successful move it into comp It just seems a gamble to immediately put it into comp What do you guys think,Perks in comp I d love to get a civil discussion going about the perks being in competitive off day one I ve seen a lot of posts about the perks and people seem very divided on it Some people hate it and some people love it I can see both sides but I d like to spark an objective discussion about its place in competitive Here are my thoughts for starters I wish they d take things slow I get that regardless of which you prefer MR is posing some competition right now and OW has to cook something big But as a long time overwatch and competitive player I was already stoked for map voting and hero bans I really think they re good additions for competitive and can handle some counter swapping and frustrating issues in the game Nobody has to versus widow anymore I as tracer no longer have to deal with turrets and nobody needs to fight orisa for example Simultaneously we wo nt have annoying map metas like widow on circuit royale I wish

Why does 6v6 need so many tests but perks are going to just be dropped immediately I know a lot of people are excited for the more wacky perks to spice up gameplay but theyre not well balanced double jump reset on dash or 30 lifesteal on blade is a nobrainer or give insane sustain for already great characters giving tracer basically double blinks Im just not sure why they didnt test these to see if it wouldnt break the game or even be fun to play against when thats some of the reasons weve been having to do all these constant 6v6 tests Edit I did not know that perks had gotten feedback from other gamemodes like junkensteins lab I mostly stick to comp Its reassuring to hear the feedback was pretty positive I just hope they can balance these perk choices for a competitive environment when theyre still struggling with just the base kits,Why does 6v6 need so many tests but perks are going to just be dropped immediately I know a lot of people are excited for the more wacky perks to spice up gameplay but they re not well balanced double jump reset on dash or 30 lifesteal on blade is a nobrainer or give insane sustain for already great characters giving tracer basically double blinks I m just not sure why they did nt test these to see if it would nt break the game or even be fun to play against when that s some of the reasons we ve been having to do all these constant 6v6 tests Edit I did not know that perks had gotten feedback from other gamemodes like junkensteins lab I mostly stick to comp Its reassuring to hear the feedback was pretty positive I just hope they can balance these perk choices for a competitive environment when they re still struggling with just the base kits,why do 6v6 need so many test but perk be go to just be drop immediately I know a lot of people be excited for the more wacky perk to spice up gameplay but they re not well balanced double jump reset on dash or 30 lifesteal on blade be a nobrainer or give insane sustain for already great character give tracer basically double blink I m just not sure why they do not test these to see if it would not break the game or even be fun to play against when that s some of the reason we ve be have to do all these constant 6v6 test Edit I do not know that perk have get feedback from other gamemode like junkenstein lab I mostly stick to comp its reassuring to hear the feedback be pretty positive I just hope they can balance these perk choice for a competitive environment when they re still struggle with just the base kit,6v6 need test perk drop immediately know lot people excited wacky perk spice gameplay balanced double jump reset dash 30 lifesteal blade nobrainer insane sustain great character tracer basically double blink m sure test break game fun play s reason ve constant 6v6 test Edit know perk feedback gamemode like junkenstein lab stick comp reassuring hear feedback pretty positive hope balance perk choice competitive environment struggle base kit
I am not hyped about the upcoming changes Am I the only one who is not hyped at all for those upcoming changes Dont get me wrong there is some cool shit coming but for me most of it is just the same old Blizzard behavior They are avoiding again what the community wants and do literally everything else than fixing the problems the game currently has Those upcoming changes are just again a workaround that dont directly address the problems but try to mitigate some of them with new shiny stuff Just like S9 its gonna be new and fresh everything feels fine at first until people again for the 100th time realize that nothing really changed for the better All those new shiny toys we will get dont mean anything to me if the core gameplay of the game still sucks Yes I am talking about the broken 5v5 format nobody wanted which still has more problems than 6v6 could ever have Perks and new modes will not fix those problems Couterswapping will still even with perks be more important and effective than trying to make your character work If ultimates right now dont matter in the counterswap game why would perks matter What I would have liked to see permanent 6v6 remove 5v5 literally just reboot the old engine import the new heroes and maps and you literally have less work than fixing the engine to handle 6v6 fix the balance more risk more reward instead of low skill heroes getting more value on the skill floor than high skill heroes get on their ceiling let heroes be specialists again instead of generalists not every hero needs to be playable at all times but every hero needs to excel at their specialty remove S9 health changes remove passives expect the passive heal removerework all those immortality reactive abilities not ultimates actual level borders instead of rank border end card system like OW1 LFG system in game remove the 2 from Overwatch 2 etc What we got instead are a new pair of shoes when we needed pants and a shirt instead,I am not hyped about the

According to devs Stadium was under development for years and 3rd Person POV took a long time and a lot of efforts to make it works smoothly Tweets from imAVRL Because people genuinely still dont understand how long it takes to develop major features and entire new game modes Gavin Winter Senior Systems Designer OW on Emonggs stream mentioned that theres been a whole separate team dedicated to making the new Stadium mode for a lot of the time Gavin has been at Blizzard For context Gavin has been at Blizzard for nearly 4 years He also mentions that gameplay engineers have been working on Stadium for the past few years Stadium having been worked on for 3 years lines up with the timeline of Hero Missions being publicly announced to be cancelled in May 16th 2023 with strong rumours that indicate Hero Missions were internally scrapped at least a year before that Meaning that if developers were reassigned from Hero Missions to Stadium in early 2022 it has now been 3 years almost exactly to the day lining up with the timeline Gavin alluded to in his comments People also need to remember its been nearly a year and a half since the Diablo collaboration when we first got to see some of the early testing of perksskill trees in gameplay publicly We just didnt know what project we were publicly testing for until now It makes sense to reassign developers and convert the work done on PvE into something more in line with the true direction of OW which is PvP game play Stadium is the result of that taking the best parts from the old Hero Missions project and transforming it into something else that works better for the current game All of this to say development doesnt happen in 2 months To the dismay of the far too many people that somehow think it does Hero bans are basically confirmed to be a response to MR Other than that most of the features have been in the works for a while OW2 has had a track record now of walking back bad initial decisions like bp locked heroes but people will never give them credit for that even though things like that happened way before MR was even announced In fact theres good evidence to suggest the opposite where MR walked back their decision to paywall their own heroes because of the backlash in OW Anyone who played MR beta saw the unlockedlocked hero tabs in the game that no longer exist after launch On 3rd Person POV Gavin said I know chat probably wouldnt believe this but weve been working on the 3rd Person thing for a long time Its been something weve been working on for quite a while It took a lot of work to get to this point and theyre still not done working on it When we first did 3rd Person quite a while back the initial feedback was hard to aim so theyve had to do so much work with the camera inaudible the projectiles working well so theres a lot that going into trying to make it feels appropriate,According to devs Stadium was under development for years and 3rd Person POV took a long time

Finally excited about overwatch again Im someone whos played Overwatch since it released wayyy back in the very beginning when we had barely half the characters we do now and everything was radically different And Im also one of those people who constantly shit on 2 and say I miss overwatch 1 and blah blah blah Because I do in my mind just about everything about OW1 was better Im not here to argue about that its just my opinion not objective fact so youre entitled to think otherwise just as I am But it always just felt to me like Overwatch 2 was a downgrade in every way Worse in every way A certain other game came out recently and I had fully quit Overwatch Playing said game reminded me of how I felt playing Overwatch 1 I loved loved loved it I still love it I havent stopped playing in the mere 2ish months its been out I plan to continue playing it constantly I had fully uninstalled Overwatch and I thought Id never do that I was ready to say goodbye and just remember it fondly instead of engaging in a bastardized version of it that I hated So as someone whos a big Overwatch 1 fanboy and a massive fan of that other game Im trying not to name it lol and pretty much despised OW2 I have to say that everything theyre adding has me excited The perks look like such a fun way to mix the core game up and I cant wait to get my hands on it but more than that Stadium That looks so much fun I was watching Flats play it and the moment he starts literally FLYING as Reinhardt I knew I had to play that mode I know it wont come for a little while longer but still Even the new competitive weapons look neat and I usually dont care about those but the galaxy theme is so cool I probably will continue not to buy any skins if their prices dont get more reasonable Same with that one game I was alluding to Ive only bought battle passes 22 dollars for a skin is just absurd but Perks Stadium and everything else were getting soon makes me actually excited and want to try the game again Whats the communitys consensus on all of this,Finally excited about overwatch again I m someone who s played Overwatch since it released wayyy back in the very beginning when we had barely half

Which perks do you think will get nerfed first or even before release So I was watching a few of the streams from Wednesday and I think there are a few that will get nerfed pretty quick for being too strong out of the ones weve seen which do we expect first Imo Reapers new long range shot will be nerfed quick cause it has a one shot combo in the tests and we know the devs do not like one shots in general,Which perks do you think will get nerfed first or even before release So I was watching a few of the streams from Wednesday and I think there are a few that will get nerfed pretty quick for being too strong out of the ones we ve seen which do we expect first Imo Reapers new long range shot will be nerfed quick cause it has a one shot combo in the tests and we know the devs do not like one shots in general,which perk do you think will get nerfe first or even before release so I be watch a few of the stream from Wednesday and I think there be a few that will get nerfe pretty quick for be too strong out of the one we ve see which do we expect first Imo Reapers new long range shot will be nerfe quick cause it have a one shot combo in the test and we know the devs do not like one shot in general,perk think nerfe release watch stream Wednesday think nerfe pretty quick strong ve expect Imo Reapers new long range shot nerfe quick cause shot combo test know devs like shot general
Is Overwatch back with S15 Or just another failure I watched the Overwatch Spotlight video on YouTube live as it was releasedjust like many others Im sure Perks loot boxes and hero portraits actually got me a bit hyped for Season 15 What are your opinion Is the Overwatch we loved truly back or is this just another failure Personal thoughts Right after the live stream I opened the game and jumped into a few competitive matches And thats when I was reminded of why I quit a few seasons ago Im not the best player and usually hover around the Diamond rank on all roles but heres how the game currently feels to me Tanks are still raid bosses DPSing is okayish Supports have basically become the games dedicated healers again It feels like the individual impact on a matchs outcome has shifted heavily towards certain roles and honestly thats quite disheartening From a balance perspective I can imagine that implementing a consistent 20 personal impact per player in a 5v5 format is challenging due to how many factors influence the outcome of a match If I remember correctly before Season 9 or in Overwatch 1 in general I never felt like I had to try this hard compared to now So all in all I cant imagine these new features will save the game unless the balance philosophy behind 5v5 changesor they bring back 6v6,Is Overwatch back with S15 Or just another failure I watched the Overwatch Spotlight video on YouTube live as it was releasedjust like many others I m sure Perks loot boxes and hero portraits actually got me a bit hyped for Season 15 What are your opinion Is the Overwatch we loved truly back or is this just another failure Personal thoughts Right after the live stream I opened the game and jumped into a few competitive matches And that s when I was reminded of why I quit a few seasons ago I m not the best player and usually hover around the Diamond rank on all roles but heres how the game currently feels to me Tanks are still raid bosses DPSing is okayish Supports have basically become the games dedicated healers again It feels like the individual impact on a matchs outcome has shifted heavily towards certain roles and honestly that s quite disheartening From a balance perspective I can imagine that implementing a consistent 20 personal impact per player in a 5v5 format is challenging due to how many factors influence the outcome of a match If I remember correctly before Season 9 or in Overwatch 1 in general I never felt like I had to try this hard compared to now So all in all I ca nt imagine these new features will save the game unless the balance philosophy behind 5v5 changesor they bring back 6v6,be overwatch back with S15 or just another failure I watch the Overwatch Spotlight video on YouTube live as it be releasedjust like many other I m sure Perks loot box and hero portrait actually get I a bit hype for Season 15 what be your opinion be the overwatch we love truly back or be this just another failure personal thought right after the live stream I open the game and jump into a few competitive match and that s when I be remind of why I quit a few season ago I m not the good player and usually hover around the Diamond rank on all role but here how the game currently feel to I tank be still raid boss DPSing be okayish Supports have basically become the game dedicated healer again it feel like the individual impact on a matchs outcome have shift heavily towards certain role and honestly that s quite disheartening from a balance perspective I can imagine that implement a consistent 20 personal impact per player in a 5v5 format be challenge due to how many factor influence the outcome of a match if I remember correctly before Season 9 or in Overwatch 1 in general I never feel like I have to try this hard compare to now so all in all I can not imagine these new feature will save the game unless the balance philosophy behind 5v5 changesor they bring back 6v6,overwatch S15 failure watch Overwatch Spotlight video YouTube live releasedjust like m sure Perks loot box hero portrait actually bit hype Season 15 opinion overwatch love truly failure personal thought right live stream open game jump competitive match s remind quit season ago m good player usually hover Diamond rank role game currently feel tank raid boss DPSing okayish Supports basically game dedicated healer feel like individual impact matchs outcome shift heavily certain role honestly s disheartening balance perspective imagine implement consistent 20 personal impact player 5v5 format challenge factor influence outcome match remember correctly Season 9 Overwatch 1 general feel like try hard compare imagine new feature save game balance philosophy 5v5 changesor bring 6v6

Perks StrategizingTheoryCrafting The basics of how you play a game of OW is determined by the teams comps The three main team comps dive spaml brawl Which usually informs a lot about your decision making They play spam we try to dive or out spam They play brawl we try to spam or out brawl They play dive we try to brawl or out spam You can usually press tab and know what your playstyle should be like this game But with the new perks the character pick no longer tells the whole story So i thought this could be a place to start strategizing what does it mean when the pick barrier on orisa etc

Aaron Keller really understands the playerbase AK Yeah I mean it almost feels like theres a few different versions of Overwatch in peoples minds It probably depends on how much youve kept up with the game and how into it you are and I think that theres been a lot of people that have stuck with Overwatch over the years that have really noticed the care and attention that weve put into it since Overwatch 2 has shipped Especially over the course of the last year weve really focused on leveling up the game I hope those people really see that with a lot of the things weve been sharing lately and hopefully that can spread out to the broader community as well But on the other hand I understand you know I understand when people have that particular view They thought that the game was going to be something that it didnt end up being I get the criticism but from the teams point of view the only thing that we can do about that now is to make the best version of this game that we can He knows who truly cares about the game and its for them that he services the current changes But at the same time he understands that Overwatch is a whole identity and that there are others who have hopes for what is possible for Overwatch Jeff wanted change but one has to change themselves too to service that and so Aaron actually changed the game to fit that mold and vision Based on recent comments and even considering how vehemently the greater community perceive the lack of PvE it almost feels like PvE is something the team will forever have to consider if they want to establish further goodwill but I think all the comments recently indicate that is simply something that will take some thinking and planning on how Overwatch can truly integrate that into the current PvP landscape The easily solution is starting with PvPvE modes with a build towards MOBA Stadium as a whole is just a great way to test so many ideas now and different ways to experience Overwatch now But I think whats interesting is that the Ramattra and Null Sector invasion is still a canon event its something they have already drafted and probably have multiple cutscenes in the work for so just like they retooled Talents to Perks and Stadium I wonder if theres a world where Overwatch can service its PvE story the way Destiny did with its seasonal model Talents and Perks allows for a lot more customization and those same abilities can likely be used by enemies too Imagine a 3 phase Ramattra boss battle which relies on different mechanics used both by the Heroes through fixed perks but also giving the bosses like Ramattra totally different mechanics so the PvE encounters dont fail I think its interesting because Invasion likely gave them good feedback on why PvE just wasnt interesting and they likely knew this and yet they still teased future story but weve actually seen the Zenyatta missions years ago so I can only imagine that they may somehow retool it to be used better This may be the same reason they simply dont talk about PvE Because theres no reason to until they have a solid plan for it And they can take their time even if it takes 5 years or more But a world where we can have potentially Overwatch Dungeons or Raids would be quite awesome And I think such mechanics to tell the story may be a better way than generic missions as the emphasis would be on creative gameplay and the rewards that come with it than playing PvP maps with just basic bots But overall its great to see that Aaron has big ideas and is willing to make the changes to fulfill them while also allowing the playerbase to be part of such progression,Aaron Keller really understands the playerbase AK Yeah I mean it almost feels like there s a few different versions of Overwatch in peoples

The most significant change Spotlight showed was the mentality shift from playing it safe to fun and taking risks In an attempt to keep the positivity going this week theres been a lot of talk about the exciting new stuff coming in the next two seasons perks stadium etc but I think the most significant part overall is this mental shift Overwatch is taking from being risk averse to actually just leaning into fun I think of perks as an example Will they be perfectly balanced No Will they take time to settle Yes But at least we are doing these things which significantly shake up the game They said the same about hero bans and map voting Theres so many reasons not to do something because youre worried about not doing it the perfect way but at this point in Overwatchs lifecycle I think having these significant shake ups is more important than striving for absolute perfection Sometimes that means owning your mistakes like what Aaron said about OW2 not being what was promised or going back to old systems ie loot boxes displayed ranks and even the 6v6 tests I for one am extremely grateful for the mentality shift the OW team has taken in being way more proactive in taking risks and putting out fun stuff and its amazing how that shift has restored some of that OG Overwatch feeling of excitement and anticipation Lets make a great game,The most significant change Spotlight showed was the mentality shift from playing it safe to fun and taking risks In an attempt to keep the positivity going this week there s been a lot of talk about the exciting new stuff coming in the next two seasons perks stadium etc but I think the most significant part overall is this mental shift Overwatch is taking from being risk averse to actually just leaning into fun I think of perks as an example Will they be perfectly balanced No Will they take time to settle Yes But at least we are doing these things which significantly shake up the game They said the same about hero bans and map voting There s so many reasons not to do something because you re worried about not doing it the perfect way but at this point in Overwatchs lifecycle I think having these significant shake ups is more important than striving for absolute perfection Sometimes that means owning your mistakes like what Aaron said about OW2 not being what was promised or going back to old systems ie loot boxes displayed ranks and even the 6v6 tests I for one am extremely grateful for the mentality shift the OW team has taken in being way more proactive in taking risks and putting out fun stuff and its amazing how that shift has restored some of that OG Overwatch feeling of excitement and anticipation Lets make a great game,the most significant change Spotlight show be the mentality shift from play it safe to fun and take risk in an attempt to keep the positivity go this week there s be a lot of talk about the exciting new stuff come in the next two season perk stadium etc but I think the most significant part overall be this mental shift Overwatch be take from be risk averse to actually just lean into fun I think of perk as an example will they be perfectly balanced no will they take time to settle yes but at least we be do these thing which significantly shake up the game they say the same about hero ban and map vote there s so many reason not to do something because you re worried about not do it the perfect way but at this point in Overwatchs lifecycle I think have these significant shake up be more important than strive for absolute perfection sometimes that mean own your mistake like what Aaron say about OW2 not be what be promise or go back to old system ie loot box display rank and even the 6v6 test I for one be extremely grateful for the mentality shift the OW team have take in be way more proactive in take risk and put out fun stuff and its amazing how that shift have restore some of that OG Overwatch feeling of excitement and anticipation Lets make a great game,significant change Spotlight mentality shift play safe fun risk attempt positivity week s lot talk exciting new stuff come season perk stadium etc think significant overall mental shift Overwatch risk averse actually lean fun think perk example perfectly balanced time settle yes thing significantly shake game hero ban map vote s reason worried perfect way point Overwatchs lifecycle think significant shake important strive absolute perfection mean mistake like Aaron OW2 promise old system ie loot box display rank 6v6 test extremely grateful mentality shift OW team way proactive risk fun stuff amazing shift restore OG Overwatch feeling excitement anticipation Lets great game

More interesting Mercy perks Redesign I really like the new perk system Most heros have really interesting options But Blizzard could have been a bit more creative with a few of the heros For example the only interesting perk for mercy is Flash Heal Instead of complaining about the perks i dont like Im just going to redesign the 3 other perks to make them more inspiring I think that will my point more clear # Mercy Perks Redesign Minor Perk 1 Friend or Foe Mercy can target enemy heroes with guardian angel Gives Mercy more possibilities to outplay her enemies Synergizes with Major Perk 2 Minor Perk 2 Improved Aerodynamics Mercys horizontal speed will not reduce during Angelic Descent Allows Mercy to keep the momentum speed from her GA or from enemy boops Synergizes with the knockback of Major Perk 2 I think during Mercys first movement rework in Overwatch 1 there was a version of Guardian Decent that didnt slow you down at all You would keep your speed until you would hit the ground or use GA Major Perk 1 Flash Heal Resurrect can be used on Caduceus Staffs active target to restore 150 health Doing so incurs a 15 second cooldown This perk is not new I kinda like Blizzards idea so I kept it Major Perk 2 Highvelocity Impact Mercys quick melee does 70 damage when she is traveling faster than 10 ms vertically or horizontally Hitting an enemy will create a pressure wave pushing mercy and the target that was hit apart 10 ms can be reached with GA jumping from a high place or getting booped by the enemy team Gives Mercys with good movement the opportunity to deal a bit of quick damage from time to time Does work with her staff and her blaster Can be used defensively with Minor Perk 1 to deal with enemy flankers Can be used aggressively with Minor Perk 1 but with great risk Can be used defensively with Minor Perk 2 to create more distance between you and enemy flankers Can be used aggressively with Minor Perk 2 by steering towards the enemy but with great risk I hope to get some feedback about these new perks If you have some other ideas about possible mercy perks please share them Im interested in hearing your ideas,More interesting Mercy perks Redesign I

Is there a site or video that has a breakdown or detail of all Stadium abilities for each hero I have watched a few videos of streamers that got to play the new Stadium mode during the OW2 Spotlight reveal There are an insane amount of ability modifiers andor additions to kits for each of the heroes that will be in the new Stadium mode Just wondering if there is a detailed video or site that has a breakdown of all of these abilities for the 15 16 different heroes Note I am not talking about the new Perks level 1 2 that are separate from Stadium as there is plenty of info and videos on those,Is there a site or video that has a breakdown or detail of all Stadium abilities for each hero I have watched a few videos of streamers that got to play the new Stadium mode during the OW2 Spotlight reveal There are an insane amount of ability modifiers andor additions to kits for each of the heroes that will be in the new Stadium mode Just wondering if there is a detailed video or site that has a breakdown of all of these abilities for the 15 16 different heroes Note I am not talking about the new Perks level 1 2 that are separate from Stadium as there is plenty of info and videos on those,be there a site or video that have a breakdown or detail of all Stadium ability for each hero I have watch a few video of streamer that get to play the new Stadium mode during the OW2 Spotlight reveal there be an insane amount of ability modifier andor addition to kit for each of the hero that will be in the new Stadium mode just wonder if there be a detailed video or site that have a breakdown of all of these ability for the 15 16 different hero note I be not talk about the new Perks level 1 2 that be separate from Stadium as there be plenty of info and video on those,site video breakdown detail Stadium ability hero watch video streamer play new Stadium mode OW2 Spotlight reveal insane ability modifier andor addition kit hero new Stadium mode wonder detailed video site breakdown ability 15 16 different hero note talk new Perks level 1 2 separate Stadium plenty info video
What are your thoughts on your mains perks Obviously we have very little idea on how strong any of these perks are before playing but I thought it would be fun to see if people are happyexcited with the perks their main hero has For me I think Dvas remech radius one is a gimmick that I dont see myself picking too often However I do like the choice that her major perks provide even if I think I will pick her sheild regen one most of the time,What are your thoughts on your mains perks Obviously we have very little idea on how strong any of these perks are before playing but I thought it would be fun to see if people are happyexcited with the perks their main hero has For me I think Dvas remech radius one is a gimmick that I do nt see myself picking too often However I do like the choice that her major perks provide even if I think I will pick her sheild regen one most of the time,what be your thought on your main perk obviously we have very little idea on how strong any of these perk be before play but I think it would be fun to see if people be happyexcite with the perk their main hero have for I I think Dvas remech radius one be a gimmick that I do not see myself pick too often however I do like the choice that her major perk provide even if I think I will pick her sheild regen one most of the time,thought main perk obviously little idea strong perk play think fun people happyexcite perk main hero think Dvas remech radius gimmick pick like choice major perk provide think pick sheild regen time
Sombra and Doomfist Rework ideas So basically I was playing Classic Overwatch and thought to myself while playing Sombra this heroe has changed so much The same happened with Doomfist I did play overwatch 1 is just that I couldnt well remember how they felt Then I realised that Sombra and Doomfist have changed so much that they have lost their essence as heroes Sombra was supposed to be a sneaky utility dps and now she is an assasin like every other Doomfist used to be a high mobility combo assasin and now he is another dive tank like Winston Its sad seeing Doomfist and Sombra lose what was considered their identity and I think blizzard should use perks to rework this heroes These are my ideas For Sombra she had less mobility less assasin capabilities and more utility When they reworked her they removed the hack problem which was CC and added assasin capabilities to her character that were ultimately a detriment sin e people found an invisible assasin quite annoying with good reason and they started getting rid of aspects that were part of Sombras original kit To this day she assasin more My idea is to look back at her rework in overwatch 2 and instead of turning her into an assasin changing the utilty she had Taking advantage of Sombra having a support perk Ill make her a support First of all I will add a passive to Sombra called One less heroe Allies that are outside Sombras range 20 meters or visual range will heal 15 hp per second IF she is alive This passive is to encourage Sombra to flank and cause chaos in the enemy backline while still supporting her team without Virus dealing damage or hack dealing bonus damage shell be a lot less assasin so shell not be super annoying Hack My goal with hack is for it to be a more focus this enemy ability Bringing rewards to allies that attack hacked enemies Hack now will additionally make it so that allies that deal 100 damage to hacked targets will heal 100 burst healing Wall hacks stay the same Ability lockdown time reduced to 125 seconds Hack no longer grants damage boost Hack can now hack allies which will give them wall hacks for 2 seconds and will give them a 30 speed boost for 4 seconds Translocator Translocator now functions exactly like overwatch 1 It has a 15 second duration Now during translocator uptime you turn invisible and come out while shooting but automatically stealth in again after not doing anything for 2 seconds To translocate now you need to be within 25 meters of your translocator Virus No longer deals damage now it can be thrown at allies it has a small home ONLY into allies When thrown into allies it now enables Sombras machine gun to heal the exact same healing as damage and has a 4 second cooldown Lasts on allies for ten seconds when thrown on enemies all healing they receive will heal them and then 15 seconds after it will detonate completely nullifying the healing they received It lasts for 5 seconds and for example if you throw the virus on a Mauga with 80 Hp then he receives healing from Ana 75 and then he receives 90 damage 807515590 65 then 15 seconds after Ana healed him hell receive a burst of 75 damage in this case killing himkills granted to Sombra Has a 13 second cooldown on enemies and can be cleanced For Doomfist I want to preserve his combo potential while keeping him as a tank This is a smaller rework but still a fun one Powe block can also empower seismic slam Seismic slam damage increases overtime from 20 damage to 100 it rates very slowly you would need to slam in the air a lot to get the 100 damage when empowered seismic slam now has a second usage after activation Basically after activating it when you touch the ground if it is empowered you can use it again and it will do an uppercut instead The uppercut will do 25 damage and will waste the empowerment of the punch It is a simple yet fun mechanic to maintain Dooms essence as a combo hero,Sombra and Doomfist Rework ideas So basically I was playing

Hero Design Learning from MOBAs for Overwatch 2s Future With the announcement of Freya Aqua its got me thinking about hero design in Overwatch 2 and how it might evolve as the hero roster grows MOBAs with their massive rostersDota 2 and League of Legends alone have a combined 296 heroeshave faced similar challenges in creating fresh unique heroes over the years Both MOBAs have also implemented hero ban systems which Overwatch 2 has just announced it will be adding Last year Dota 2 introduced facets which is strikingly similar to Overwatch 2s upcoming perk system These systems have had a big impact on game balance and strategy in MOBAs at least in Dota so its interesting to see Overwatch 2 adopt similar concepts along with hero bans as both Dota and League have had Are there any design takeaways from MOBAs that could help expand the Overwatch 2 hero pool in meaningful ways Is there an inevitable limit to creating unique FPS heroes as the roster grows Having played both Dota 2 and League of Legends before switching to Overwatch 2 I cant help but imagine how some of the most fun and satisfying heroes in MOBAs could be adapted to FPS For example Invoker in Dota 2 is one of my alltime favorite heroes but Ive struggled to theory craft its core mechanics into an FPS setting For those of you whove played MOBAs are there any hero abilities or concepts youd love to see make their way into Overwatch 2 What could Overwatch 2 learn from the way MOBAs design their everexpanding rosters EDIT For anyone who hasnt played either MOBA before but is interested in the general

Should open queue become the main 6v6 mode Hey everyone with them experimenting with 6v6 in the next update and onward wouldnt it better if 5v5 open queue is just replaced with 6v6 and they balance it around being open queue The want for 6v6 comes from a fairly fundamental return to formula for many people I think this would make a good balance for the game 5v5 is role queue giving a more balanced experience But open queue gives you that freedom many players are looking for in the game hell sometimes I jump on open queue just to have a good time You should honestly try it sometime and just enjoy it However if anyone here likes 5v5 open queue please speak up and tell me if you would hate this open queue has always been fairly scuffed and looked down on by the greater community I think this would give it a good difference Conversely what about you guys who want a 6v6 role queue do you think it could exist without overtaking the main 5v5 format of the game My idea with this is that it wouldnt overtake the 5v5 format for the developers since they are so attached to it But it could also add a spice to open queue so it isnt just that scuffed clusterfuck thats terribly balanced btw Some tanks in open queue are useless while 2 tanks is always too strong in 5v5 open queue Could balance it out tbh edit oh yea should add that perks actually fix a tom of issues with open queue Feel like people will go on tank and support and actually stay on them since you have aggressive options for perks or even defensive Hell even some utility too Would incentive balanced teams,Should open

Thoughts on smurfing and perks People who smurf I think generally fall into two categories 1 People who enjoy winning 2 People who enjoy playing with friends differently ranked friends For the first set we cant really do much except adjust their mmr such that it moves to a higher level quicker and stays there while disregarding throwing attempts I was glad when they announced recently that new accounts would have their mmr adjusted quicker if the player shows that theyre experienced and not totally new players It shows that they have ways of identifying good players so handling smurfs should not be a big problem either For the second set I feel that they would be less incentivize to create new accounts to smurf if there was a way to balance the matches even when theyre on their original mmr account I know Overwatch tries to match similar skill levels on both teams But it still makes the experience unpleasant for the weaker players on both teams What if handicaps are added to better players or buffs given to weaker players instead Finding a balance would be tough but I think the new perks system is a good starting point Allow weaker players to gain perks quicker than stronger players For example a bronze player should get their 2nd perk before a gm player gets their first perk This would be opposite of what Ive been hearing how perks work Apparently its like gaining ult charge where the more healing or damage the more ult charge and also faster perk gains Im not sure if this works out better than the halloween event way where everyone gains perks at the same rate aka after every round I felt like that event balanced the playing field better and made games more enjoyable I really enjoy playing more or less balanced games rather than onesided wins or losses Not sure about everyone else though Edit People commenting abt other reasons but whatever the exact reason one just wants to smurf but the other cant help but smurf to achieve what they want So Im wondering if there are ways to solve the problem for the 2nd group of people Whether its queue time teaming up with friends or anything else aside from styling on weaker players The fact that Jay3 has made a few videos of high ranked vs low ranked players show that it is possible for people of different ranks to play and have fun together For example there was a buffed Aspen top 500 support vs a group of bronze players Or gold vs master with master losing a player each time they win Or 2 buffed bronze vs 10 nerfed GM players Note I dont consider unranked to GM smurfing unless its bronze to

Is perks gonna make games more lopsided Building ult by killing the other team already gives the winning team momentum They just removed Assault mode from comp because it often lead to steamrolled victories It seems like adding perks that reward winning play will further favor teams that start out stronger I love the idea of this mechanic and think itll add a lot of depth and interest to the game I love that Blizzard is putting aside prolevel balance in favor of novelty and casual fun But I feel like more steamrolling is inevitable with this Any thoughts,Is perks gon na make games more lopsided Building ult by killing the other team already gives the winning team momentum They just removed Assault mode from comp because it often lead to steamrolled victories It seems like adding perks that reward winning play will further favor teams that start out stronger I love the idea of this mechanic and think it ll add a lot of depth and interest to the game I love that Blizzard is putting aside prolevel balance in favor of novelty and casual fun But I feel like more steamrolling is inevitable with this Any thoughts,be perk go to make game more lopsided Building ult by kill the other team already give the win team momentum they just remove Assault mode from comp because it often lead to steamroll victory it seem like add perk that reward win play will far favor team that start out strong I love the idea of this mechanic and think it ll add a lot of depth and interest to the game I love that Blizzard be put aside prolevel balance in favor of novelty and casual fun but I feel like more steamrolling be inevitable with this any thought,perk game lopsided Building ult kill team win team momentum remove Assault mode comp lead steamroll victory like add perk reward win play far favor team start strong love idea mechanic think ll add lot depth interest game love Blizzard aside prolevel balance favor novelty casual fun feel like steamrolling inevitable thought

My biggest concerns with Stadium queue times and longevity So IMO Overwatch Stadium looks like probably the second best thing Blizzard ever announced for Overwatch behind the cancelled PvE and Stadium is actually locked in to launch in 2 months unlike PvE However I have some grave concerns for its longevity as we know Stadium is going to be a permanent mode and an integral part of the OW2 ecosystem come season 16 A big reason for my concern is the fact it launches with only 14 heroes a handful of maps with promise of more coming gradually as time goes on We saw what happened to story missions which are no longer released after the first 3 flopped financially and feedbackwise which brings me to my next point I guess Stadium itself sounds incredible on paper itll have endless variation and a hella lot more replayability than a handful of paywalled storyheavy scripted quests but i guess we wont find out until Season 16 if itll stand the test of time and will be kept to speed with the base pvp experience from then onwards especially we need to really see how good the mode is in our hands Coming to think of it story hero gauntlet and now hero mastery are all abandoned as of now but they all have something in common they were lackluster with not much replayability if stadium can overcome these hurdles itll surely be here to stay right which comes to another point i suggested in the title queue times if Stadium is an absolute hit there is still grave concerns for how long the honeymoon period lasts and if people will genuinely stay interested it is permanent after all I guess Practice vs AI still has plenty of players in certain regions but it has been also been all but abandoned no clash no new hero bots since mauga which reminds me workshop is abandoned and bugged i love overwatch 2 in its current state dont get me wrong but i really want to be assured Stadium is here for the long haul and that it remains a key part of what makes this game unique and special who knows itll probably be so popular that base pvp will be shafted lol it happened in other games The last concern i have is having a ranking system which comp pisses me off constantly because of it but i guess thats just a skill issue lol,My biggest concerns with Stadium queue times and longevity So IMO Overwatch Stadium looks like probably the second best thing Blizzard ever announced for Overwatch

Make your feedback clear about changes to the game s15 perk system TLDR Perk system are bad change to try to gain attention from casual players and compete with MR making the ow experience worse than it already was on top of the rest of the playerbase It is clear to me that the changes implemented were not even tested in the hacked quick mode or in any other type of laboratory and only served as a pretext to attract a new audience to the game to the detriment of everything that had been established and built until now to try to compete with MR as something new and fresh It turns out that the perks system does not solve any of the giant problems that ow still presents to this day which is the issue of balancing on a fine line matchmaking and counterswap the latter since the introduction of 5x5 and ow2 In fact this system has only made the games situation worse the matches I enter are more stomp than ever and it seems that all the problems of the recently bankrupt paladins are now ows problems Im already seeing people ordering to change characters and come back because of not getting perk lv 2 x for a certain character which is the goalmeta one the system in addition to the ult benefits even more the teams that are winning and the counterswap on tanks has gotten worse a buffed zarya is practically unstoppable even with the lv 2 perks of both her counters reinwinston and those she already countered dva orisa Mauga etc And its good that you make your feedback clear especially if its negative because if not it will become commonplace for devs just like S9 with the

Overwatch2 Has a Serious Balance Problem Right Now Over multiple seasons DPS heroesespecially hitscan charactershave been excessively nerfed while relatively easytoplay support heroes have consistently received buffs As a result support players have been able to climb to higher ranks with less effort and this has been a longstanding frustration for me At this point I dont feel like DPS heroes have any significant advantages over support heroes whether in terms of damage output or survivability Now with the introduction of Perks in Season 15 the imbalance has only gotten worse DPS Perks provide little to no direct damage increase even if there are any they often come with conditions or debuffs Meanwhile support Perks overwhelmingly provide straightforward buffs to their abilities with no drawbacks Not only that but the power creep on some of these support Perks is outright ridiculous For example Ashes Perk increases her fire speed but lowers her damage and she must land consecutive snipe shots to get additional damage Meanwhile Anas nade simply doubles in radius by simply pressing a single button and she can apply nanoboost to both herself and an ally that gives her insane survivability and damage potential in a teamfight with zero risk Does this sound like a fair patch Updates like this drastically reduce the appeal of playing DPS which in turn weakens the identity of Overwatch as an aimbased FPS game Why does Blizzard keep buffing easytoplay roles and heroes while neglecting or nerfing mechanically demanding ones At this rate I genuinely wonder if their end goal is to make Overwatch a 5v5 game where only support players remain because thats exactly where were headed,Overwatch2 Has a Serious Balance Problem Right Now Over multiple seasons DPS

Feeling really bad about perks Ive been playing Overwatch since its launch and while Im definitely never against trying something new having tried the perks in a good handful of games now I really dont like the new feel of the game One thing that made OW2 such a mess for a lot of fans was the changing of core mechanics 6v6 to 5v5 being the main example I dont understand why Blizzard thinks that overcomplicating the core gameplay like this is going to do anything but appease a handful of fans and completely alienate the others especially those like myself who have learned and loved this game for years now Perks add a level of unpredictability into the game which while it would definitely be chaotic and fun for an arcade game mode in my opinion should never have made it to quick play and definitely not comp Theres already so much to learn about Overwatch especially with new heroes coming out every season Now on top of that you have to remember perks keep track of them by constantly looking at the scoreboard taking attention away from the game and try to calculate new cooldown times ability usages etc Not to mention many of the perks are so incomparable in usefulness Some are cracked some are borderline useless and many completely alter the way the game and certain heroes play to me ruining the feel for the game that Ive loved for so long By adding perks into QP and comp especially immediately without some form of testinggrace period one of my favourite games no longer feels like my favourite game I cant opt out of perks unless I choose to play solely arcade but with this change I simply cant play Overwatch 1 anymore Thats my feelings on the matter anyway Im interested to hear how other people feel because Ive honestly seen a majority negative reaction which makes me feel less crazy haha,Feeling really bad about perks I ve been playing Overwatch since its launch and while I m definitely never against trying something new having tried the perks in a good handful

Perks feel like a very fun system with a bright future ahead early impressions Its only day one but my impression so far is that perks are first and foremost a very fun system It doesnt disrupt the traditional flow of OW matches but brings something fresh to the table with matches evolving through time and many new possibilities for making amazing plays with the heroes with love Especially as a flex player it feels like the game has given me 168 new toys to play with each one allowing for new playstyles to be uncovered and this excitement of discovery and possibilities hasnt been present in the game for a long time I also havent felt the need to counter anymore since playing to my perks strengths seem to allow heroes to work even against their counters The system is probably not perfect and sameness or other problems will eventually settle in again but it feels like a bright start and I cant help but wonder where they could take this system in the future Should they keep it as is and only balance or substitute overunderperforming perks Or could they expand the system Imagine having 3 perk levels with 4 options each Or maybe each hero skill could have two perks to choose The possibilities are endless,Perks feel like a very fun system with a bright future ahead early impressions Its only day one but my impression so far is that perks are first and foremost a very fun system It does nt disrupt the traditional flow of OW matches but brings something fresh to the table with matches evolving through time and many new possibilities for making amazing plays with the heroes with love Especially as a flex player it feels like the game has given me 168 new toys to play with each one allowing for new playstyles to be uncovered and this excitement of discovery and possibilities has nt been present in the game for a long time I also have nt felt the need to counter anymore since playing to my perks strengths seem to allow heroes to work even against their counters The system is probably not perfect and sameness or other problems will eventually settle in again but it feels like a bright start and I ca nt help but wonder where they could take this system in the future Should they keep it as is and only balance or substitute overunderperforming perks Or could they expand the system Imagine having 3 perk levels with 4 options each Or maybe each hero skill could have two perks to choose The possibilities are endless,perk feel like a very fun system with a bright future ahead early impression its only day one but my impression so far be that perk be first and foremost a very fun system it do not disrupt the traditional flow of ow match but bring something fresh to the table with match evolve through time and many new possibility for make amazing play with the hero with love especially as a flex player it feel like the game have give I 168 new toy to play with each one allow for new playstyle to be uncover and this excitement of discovery and possibility have not be present in the game for a long time I also have not feel the need to counter anymore since play to my perk strength seem to allow hero to work even against their counter the system be probably not perfect and sameness or other problem will eventually settle in again but it feel like a bright start and I can not help but wonder where they could take this system in the future should they keep it as be and only balance or substitute overunderperforme perk or could they expand the system Imagine have 3 perk level with 4 option each or maybe each hero skill could have two perk to choose the possibility be endless,perk feel like fun system bright future ahead early impression day impression far perk foremost fun system disrupt traditional flow ow match bring fresh table match evolve time new possibility amazing play hero love especially flex player feel like game 168 new toy play allow new playstyle uncover excitement discovery possibility present game long time feel need counter anymore play perk strength allow hero work counter system probably perfect sameness problem eventually settle feel like bright start help wonder system future balance substitute overunderperforme perk expand system Imagine 3 perk level 4 option maybe hero skill perk choose possibility endless

The perk system is perfect it gives the Dev team the chance to combine all the lost OW1 and OW2 abilities into a single game Heres some example Id love to see Basically I think the perk system is an excelent addition to Overwatch but some Heros perks should be reworked into bring back lost abilities back into the game similar to how Orisa Torb and Bastion got their classic abilities back Heres some examples Roadhog His rework should be reverted E is for healing and his secondary fire is back in the game Lvl2 Perks Scrap Hook Chain Hook hits reload two ammo Invigorate Take a Breather rapidly increases Roadhogs move speed by 30 Lvl3 Perks Pig Pen Replace your secondary fire with a trap that can be placed on the floor and damages enemies Hogdrogen Exposure Take a Breather also heals nearby allies for 50 of its healing Now we can play with both original Roadhog AND enjoy Pig Pen gameplay if we so desire Doomfist Lvl2 Perks OneTwo Hitting an enemy with Rocket Punch reloads all Hand Cannon ammo Seismic Empowerment Hitting 3 or more enemies with Seismic Slam empowers Rocket Punch Lvl3 Perks Rising Uppercut Power Block is replaced with Rising Uppercut allowing you to lift enemies into the air at a reduced damage Power Matrix Power Block absorbs projectiles for the first two seconds of its duration Now Doomfist can choose between empowering his Anchor Tank playstyle or trade tankines for some extra mobility and CC thanks to his Rising Uppercut Symettra Lvl2 Perks Advanced Teleportation Teleporter cast range increased by 50 Perfect Alignment Primary Fire has a faster charge to max

best and worst perks i have a decent game count so far to give my opinion on some perks itd be cool if we could compile what we think are the best and worst perks for each hero before that id like to ask for a few QoL changes to perks first it would be amazing if we could classify perk 1 and 2 as A and B and then we could bind a specific button for that perk that way i can bind my favorite perks on every hero to always be on M2 second it would be great if echo could still get perk progress while duplicating AND could choose a perk while in dupe my thoughts on the heroes ive played Sombra both her tier 2 perks are dog but they are fairly balanced between them id say pick virus reset on kill for tier 3 perks they are kinda baffling as both actively make my hacking experience worse if one keeps practicing and plays with low hack sens though the white hat one should be good for emp 1s extra on silence would barely be in line with other perks but the range reduction is brutal feels like a straight nerf Pharah played a lot of pharah both her tier 2 perks are chill not too powerful and i think comp dependant playing without a zen mercy or brig i usually took the shields for tier 3 i dont like the vaccum blast because it messes with my escape i dont like the fact it also pulls you in i like the mobility so i think the extra fuel is better and also boring Echo my most played hero so far i like both the tier 2 picks and i think they r situational they have dog hero picks for dupe but your team doesnt but i personally just fell in love with the extra time in dupe been asking for that for years and it makes everything so much more flexible since i can now dupe sigmas and illaris and anas so much more often as for tier 3 i like all and think they are balanced beam reset is very useful vs certain dps you wanna flank Venture much like sombra ventures perks are very uninspiring tier 2 i choose blindsight 9 times out of 10 tho for tier 3 i think extra range is the better choice but i dont think the other one is terrible,best and worst perks i have a decent game count so far to give my opinion on some perks it d be cool if we could compile what we think are the best and worst

an idea on perks I really like this new system I feel that some of the new perks need to be balanced a little though But I was thinking This system gave at least for me a breath of fresh air into this game and I think they can actually improve One thing that Ive thought could be a nice feature is they could implement for exemple 5 minor and 5 major perks the thing is add options for each character in the character page we would have to select between 2 major and 2 minor I Think this way this system could be super flexible and adapt to each person for exemple Sombra has a major perk that consists of giving an ally a healing hack what if I dont want that and instead I could put another offensive major perk so when i upgrade in the game i could have a different one instead of the healing hack I think this would be nice thinking about longevity because someday we are probably gonna be tired of the same ones over and over again And plus they have actually a lot of different perks mainly with the content were gonna get with the stadium mode,an idea on perks I really like this new system I feel that some of the new perks need to be balanced a little though But I was thinking This system gave at least for me a breath of fresh air into this game and I think they can actually improve One thing that I ve thought could be a nice feature is they could implement for exemple 5 minor and 5 major perks the thing is add options for each character in the character page we would have to select between 2 major and 2 minor I Think this way this system could be super flexible and adapt to each person for exemple Sombra has a major perk that consists of giving an ally a healing hack what if I do nt want that and instead I could put another offensive major perk so when i upgrade in the game i could have a different one instead of the healing hack I think this would be nice thinking about longevity because someday we are probably gon na be tired of the same ones over and over again And plus they have actually a lot of different perks mainly with the content were gon na get with the stadium mode,an idea on perk I really like this new system I feel that some of the new perk need to be balance a little though but I be think this system give at least for I a breath of fresh air into this game and I think they can actually improve one thing that I ve think could be a nice feature be they could implement for exemple 5 minor and 5 major perk the thing be add option for each character in the character page we would have to select between 2 major and 2 minor I think this way this system could be super flexible and adapt to each person for exemple Sombra have a major perk that consist of give an ally a healing hack what if I do not want that and instead I could put another offensive major perk so when I upgrade in the game I could have a different one instead of the healing hack I think this would be nice thinking about longevity because someday we be probably go to be tired of the same one over and over again and plus they have actually a lot of different perk mainly with the content be go to get with the stadium mode,idea perk like new system feel new perk need balance little think system breath fresh air game think actually improve thing ve think nice feature implement exemple 5 minor 5 major perk thing add option character character page select 2 major 2 minor think way system super flexible adapt person exemple Sombra major perk consist ally healing hack want instead offensive major perk upgrade game different instead healing hack think nice thinking longevity someday probably tired plus actually lot different perk mainly content stadium mode

Tracer Major Perk Idea Damage Boost on TripleBlink I think most reasonable people would agree that the perk to refresh all 3 blinks on recall is unreasonable and I play Tracer pretty much exclusively myself The replacement suggestion is Tripleblinking grants a 10 damage boost to bullet and melee damage for 2 seconds This will increase bullet damage to 605 and melee damage to 44 significantly increasing her oneclip potential Rationale Oneclipping squishies is one of the most satisfying aspects of playing Tracer This experience mostly disappeared with the increased health pools and her bullet damage falling to 55 which is good for the health of the game imo Tying it to tripleblink makes it situational and encourages aggressive plays before a fight has started or to aggressively chase down isolated targets while discouraging its usage in a team fight because youll need to burn all your blinks to proc it Why only 2 seconds 2 seconds is plenty of time to oneclip a squishy it takes one second to shoot a full clip so you have wiggle room for trigger discipline 3 seconds would allow one blink to come back and perhaps make the ability too strong The idea is to attempt the oneclip and recall the hell out of there Works well holistically This idea contrasts well with the other major perk that makes you tankier on recall and encourages you to stay in the fight This now introduces a clear choice to make between the two perks depending on your playstyle or the enemys team comp As of now the 3blink refund is a nobrainer which isnt a fun perk system,Tracer Major Perk

Mercys and Moiras Perks should be an opportunity to optionally add more skill expression to her kit Attempts to improve on the skill curve of Mercy and Moira have always had one pretty fundamental problem their kits flow well and are cohesive and have fan bases who enjoy their low mechanical skill barriers Changing them to take more skill risks alienating those players andor ruining their gameplay flow Not changing them can be negative for the games skillreward ratio and makes them boring to many players But now we have a mechanic which can specifically fix those things without forcing any of the existing mains to change those aspects of their hero The current perks suck at doing this and should be changed For both heroes each level should be a choice between something which adds a skillexpressive replacement to one of their abilities and a quality of life buff that people who arent interested can take Currently their perks are very disappointing because they miss an obvious opportunity to fix the heroes without also ruining them for the people who currently see nothing that would need fixing This is obviously going to be somewhat limited you arent going to turn mercy into tracer with two skill swaps but it could help a lot,Mercys and Moiras Perks should be an opportunity to optionally add more skill expression to her kit Attempts to improve on the skill curve of Mercy and Moira have always had one pretty fundamental problem their kits flow well and are cohesive and have fan bases who enjoy their low mechanical skill barriers Changing them to take more skill risks alienating those players andor ruining their gameplay flow Not changing them can be negative for the games skillreward ratio and makes them boring to many players But now we have a mechanic which can specifically fix those things without forcing any of the existing mains to change those aspects of their hero The current perks suck at doing this and should be changed For both heroes each level should be a choice between something which adds a skillexpressive replacement to one of their abilities and a quality of life buff that people who are nt interested can take Currently their perks are very disappointing because they miss an obvious opportunity to fix the heroes without also ruining them for the people who currently see nothing that would need fixing This is obviously going to be somewhat limited you are nt going to turn mercy into tracer with two skill swaps but it could help a lot,Mercys and Moiras Perks should be an opportunity to optionally add more skill expression to her kit attempt to improve on the skill curve of Mercy and Moira have always have one pretty fundamental problem their kit flow well and be cohesive and have fan basis who enjoy their low mechanical skill barrier change they to take more skill risk alienate those player andor ruin their gameplay flow not change they can be negative for the game skillreward ratio and make they boring to many player but now we have a mechanic which can specifically fix those thing without force any of the exist main to change those aspect of their hero the current perk suck at do this and should be change for both hero each level should be a choice between something which add a skillexpressive replacement to one of their ability and a quality of life buff that people who be not interested can take currently their perk be very disappointing because they miss an obvious opportunity to fix the hero without also ruin they for the people who currently see nothing that would need fix this be obviously go to be somewhat limited you be not go to turn mercy into tracer with two skill swap but it could help a lot,Mercys Moiras Perks opportunity optionally add skill expression kit attempt improve skill curve Mercy Moira pretty fundamental problem kit flow cohesive fan basis enjoy low mechanical skill barrier change skill risk alienate player andor ruin gameplay flow change negative game skillreward ratio boring player mechanic specifically fix thing force exist main change aspect hero current perk suck change hero level choice add skillexpressive replacement ability quality life buff people interested currently perk disappointing miss obvious opportunity fix hero ruin people currently need fix obviously somewhat limited turn mercy tracer skill swap help lot
early thoughts on the perk system Hey all I just wrote a rather chunky analysis as a reply to someone that said they noticed people counterswapping a lot less My reply got so long i thought it would probably warrant its own post at this point Id love to hear everyones thoughts on this My reply Your observation is absolutely correct though people are very noticeably swapping a lot less From what Im seeing people often try to make it work with their initially preferred hero and then spec them into a direction that better suits the match than trying to constantly counterswap But perhaps a bigger win is that people now seem to understand that playing the map and simple changes in how you play absolutely can make a ton of difference Theres still one glaring problem some perks are much more powerful than others And not just that some heroes have a collection of random perks that really dont have a lot of symbiosis either with each other while other heroes can actually make builds that greatly change their gameplay Imo this last point is what we need for all heroes The perk system is a good start but so far from what Ive seen were going to need more direction and intent in what perks heroes get and we really need to get rid of the free value without gameplay changes options theyre boring and they dont bring anything meaningful to the table For example Ive been playing exclusively bastion since the release of s15 mostly because I never really feel like Im forced to swap Theres always something i can do with perks to make bastion at least viable So far Ive identified two builds for bastion sniperbot and brawlbot Sniperbot is really good against other snipers and gives bastion the chance to pressure from longe ranges while still being vulnerable to divers and flankers For Sniperbot you choose smart bomb and lindholm explosives Theres also brawlbot For brawlbot you choose armored artillery and self heal Brawlbot emphasizes bastions brawlbreaking capabilities while also making him much more durable against flankers and divers but not against snipers and burst damage Brawlbot is a bit harder to pull off well but the main mechanic is that self heal gives a ton of ult charge and ulting gives you 650 hp You can pick smart bomb to turn it into flankbot instead As you can see bastion actually has twothree builds that makes it so he can adapt to many different situations that hes originally very weak against snipers and divers But in order to extract the full value of the build you need to adapt your gameplay and that is why i think Bastions perks are for now pretty close to the gold standard for what perks should feel like and what they should do If you want sniperbot to work you need to leverage your range advantage and stay further away from the fight Similarly with brawlbot if you want it to work you actually need to be in a place where you can take damage in a controlled manner To do that you need cover and your team to protect you The balance is pretty hard to pin down and im honestly still learning brawlbot Bad plays become much more obvious and i feel like the game now actually tells me what i did wrong and how i can improve Sorry for the long ramble it kinda just came out but to go back to your observation I really think that putting the focus on building your hero well instead of counterswapping is a much more skillful and long term much healthier direction for the game,early thoughts on the perk system Hey all I just wrote a rather chunky analysis as a reply to someone that said they noticed people

perks didnt fix the game im not here to say you arent allowed to have fun with overwatch just getting that out of the way i keep seeing people who are loving the perks and yeah its fun it added a TON of flavor to the game but in my personal opinion flavor isnt enough the perks havent fixed ANY of the underlying issues that has driven so many players away to begin with tank still feels absolutley horrible to play orisa is still a plague on the game mercy still has a beam length the size of canada and gets INSANE VALUE for doing the bare minimum existing in the game teamates are still rude and obnoxious plus i get people baby raging every other game widow still is a server admin and losses still feel absolutley horrible while wins feel like a fluke i want to love the game again and i was hoping that this was the spark it needed to finally get it back but as soon as all the hype dies down its all going to shit again the worst part is they CANT or WONT change those things that are ruining the game tank still feels horrible because theres only 1 and they wont change that because they would have to admit they were wrong and make massive balance changes across the board orisa is still a plague because they see a 49 winrate and think she needs a 5 damage buff to her gun they cant nerf mercy because they would lose half the playerbase they cant do anything about the toxicity because thats just the kind of audience overwatch has gathered widow is a server admin because they cant remove her 1 shot without damn near scrapping the entire character and starting over and matches feel horrible because no matter how good you are doing it will always feel like you are doing bad which only gets worse with toxic teamates again i love overwatch and want it to do better and i DO have fun when i play it once a week any more than that and i feel dirty and icky after each game and as much as i love the perks i wish blizzard would listen to their community complaints more it shouldnt need 200k people constantly complaining for 6 months to get something changed perks are a baindaid fix a sparkly bandaid but a bandaid none the less and the wound is infected with gangrene a bandaid might cover it up but its not solving anything and the issues are just getting worse in the meantime,perks did nt fix the game i m not here to say you are nt allowed to have fun with overwatch

The fact that some characters last abilities are gatekept by perks is pretty astounding Bastion and Reaper Like shouldnt every character just have all of their abilities and then perks change those abilities in whatever way If bastion had self repair on a resource meter and reaper had his death volley their major perks instead could change them in whatever way maybe increasing death volley range or increasing self repairs resource meter or something like that It just feels like Oh yes my major perk Now do I want to do something fun or do I want to play a completed character Like imagine Winstons secondary fire was a perk not an ability not everyone would pick it and the character would just be straight up missing an ability Personally Im hoping they just alter and add in these perks as abilities given the fact theyre perks shows that Blizzard CAN add them in and add some more intricacies into their major perks instead of the aforementioned perk or ability With these characters in particular reapers other major perk is crazy good with the additional lifesteal upon exiting wraith and bastions cannon is situational but fun if people want to pick those perks I dont think its fair that theyre playing an unfinished character Wishing that in mid season they add in these abilities,The fact that some characters last abilities are gatekept by perks is pretty astounding Bastion and Reaper Like should nt every character just have all of their abilities and then perks change those abilities in whatever way If bastion had self repair on a resource meter and reaper had his death volley their major perks instead could change them in whatever way maybe increasing death volley range or increasing self repairs resource meter or something like that It just feels like Oh yes my major perk Now do I want to do something fun or do I want to play a completed character Like imagine Winstons secondary fire was a perk not an ability not everyone would pick it and the character would just be straight up missing an ability Personally I m hoping they just alter and add in these perks as abilities given the fact they re perks shows that Blizzard CAN add them in and add some more intricacies into their major perks instead of the aforementioned perk or ability With these characters in particular reapers other major perk is crazy good with the additional lifesteal upon exiting wraith and bastions cannon is situational but fun if people want to pick those perks I do nt think its fair that they re playing an unfinished character Wishing that in mid season they add in these abilities,the fact that some character last ability be gatekept by perk be pretty astounding Bastion and Reaper like should not every character just have all of their ability and then perk change those ability in whatever way if bastion have self repair on a resource meter and reaper have his death volley their major perk instead could change they in whatever way maybe increase death volley range or increase self repair resource meter or something like that it just feel like oh yes my major perk now do I want to do something fun or do I want to play a complete character like imagine Winstons secondary fire be a perk not an ability not everyone would pick it and the character would just be straight up miss an ability personally I m hope they just alter and add in these perk as ability give the fact they re perk show that Blizzard can add they in and add some more intricacy into their major perk instead of the aforementioned perk or ability with these character in particular reaper other major perk be crazy good with the additional lifesteal upon exiting wraith and bastion cannon be situational but fun if people want to pick those perk I do not think its fair that they re play an unfinished character wish that in mid season they add in these ability,fact character ability gatekept perk pretty astounding Bastion Reaper like character ability perk change ability way bastion self repair resource meter reaper death volley major perk instead change way maybe increase death volley range increase self repair resource meter like feel like oh yes major perk want fun want play complete character like imagine Winstons secondary fire perk ability pick character straight miss ability personally m hope alter add perk ability fact perk Blizzard add add intricacy major perk instead aforementioned perk ability character particular reaper major perk crazy good additional lifesteal exiting wraith bastion cannon situational fun people want pick perk think fair play unfinished character wish mid season add ability

All perks should have clearly visible effects Heres my take I love the perks Theyre really fun They add a new layer to Overwatch Its hard to talk about the balance of it all but in terms of being able to know whats going on some perks are just better than others When Orisa shoots down a shield you can see the shield You know she has the shield perk It kind of speaks for itself When you see Torb torb throwing turrets against the ceiling again it speaks for itself You only need to see a turret against a wall once to know that Torb can throw turrets against walls Sojourn getting 15 extra ammo You dont really see that as an opponent I mean I guess you can notice it if youre looking out for it but yeah I think perks would be great if all of them had clearasday effects You shouldnt need to open the scoreboard to see what perks your enemies have you should be able to quickly and easily see the effects of their perks even if they pick those perks mid fight,All perks should have clearly visible effects Heres my take I love the perks They re really fun They add a new layer to Overwatch Its hard to talk about the balance of it all but in terms of being able to know what s going on some perks are just better than others When Orisa shoots down a shield you can see the shield You know she has the shield perk It kind of speaks for itself When you see Torb torb throwing turrets against the ceiling again it speaks for itself You only need to see a turret against a wall once to know that Torb can throw turrets against walls Sojourn getting 15 extra ammo You do nt really see that as an opponent I mean I guess you can notice it if you re looking out for it but yeah I think perks would be great if all of them had clearasday effects You should nt need to open the scoreboard to see what perks your enemies have you should be able to quickly and easily see the effects of their perks even if they pick those perks mid fight,all perk should have clearly visible effect here my take I love the perk they re really fun they add a new layer to overwatch its hard to talk about the balance of it all but in term of be able to know what s go on some perk be just well than other when orisa shoot down a shield you can see the shield you know she have the shield perk it kind of speak for itself when you see Torb torb throw turret against the ceiling again it speak for itself you only need to see a turret against a wall once to know that Torb can throw turret against wall sojourn get 15 extra ammo you do not really see that as an opponent I mean I guess you can notice it if you re look out for it but yeah I think perk would be great if all of they have clearasday effect you should not need to open the scoreboard to see what perk your enemy have you should be able to quickly and easily see the effect of their perk even if they pick those perk mid fight,perk clearly visible effect love perk fun add new layer overwatch hard talk balance term able know s perk orisa shoot shield shield know shield perk kind speak Torb torb throw turret ceiling speak need turret wall know Torb throw turret wall sojourn 15 extra ammo opponent mean guess notice look yeah think perk great clearasday effect need open scoreboard perk enemy able quickly easily effect perk pick perk mid fight

Why perk system is wrong on a philosophical level despite being able to save OW2 pt1 Perk system is directly bloating every characters kit and it is not a good thing If everything is broken nothing is broken is not a statement that makes sense in games especially competitive ones like Overwatch 2 Characters power levels are designed around and tied to other ingame elements like maps structures and the overall style of the game Mobility creep is such a problem for most people is because of this High grounds that are designed to be hard to access become easier and easier to access with every new hero with vertical mobility released LW Illari Juno Venture Hazard and the upcoming Freja When all ten players in a match can have easy access to high ground what is the meaning of high ground anymore Sure high ground is still going to be different from flat ground but its tactical value is not going to be the same as before Perk system is doing exactly that Most of the perks are nothing gamechanging but straight buffs meaning to bloat the game Ive devided thes perks into tw categories The first one is increasing uptime This type of perks includes ashe getting bullets for hitting shots rein getting shield for firestrike lucio getting bullets for wall slide soldier getting bullets for landing rockets Orisa decreasing weapon temperature on headshots tracer getting more blinks etc This is very problematic for our current game because of how it messes with heroes downtime One of the biggest complaint of Hazard two months ago was that his uptime was too long with the blockwalljump awayjump in cycle Ashe needing to reloaddowntime after dishing out 12 long range burst dmg is an important part of her balancing and character identity How many ashe have the experience of missing the last shot not getting the kill and losing the team fight because that guy got full and ulted This is how ashe gets punished for missing shots or wasting bullets earlier Giving ashe more bullets is directly undermining this part of her identity and all the intricacy around it The same goes for all the other heroes Hog getting punished for forgetting to reload soldier running out of bullets rein hiding behind walls tracer dying after recalling with no blinks etc are all important aspects for these individual heroes and the game as a whole If everything is broken nothing is broken does not work because there are beauties in weakness and inconvenience Downtimeuptime is important in OW and the perks mentioned above are not healthy for the game because they tilt the balance between downtime and uptime People do not normally think about the concept of downtime and uptime when theyre gaming so I wont blame you if you cant see the problem presented Here is an analogy with valorant that can help further explain the situation In valorant rounds are clearly split into preplant and postplant Every agent has a limited amount of abilities with only a few abilities rechargable by time or by kills What happens in most rounds is that most of the abilities will be used preplant for entry and postplant will have a lot less abilties Only special comps like deadlockvyse comps that specifically plays for postplant can have most of their abiltiies saved for postplant Characters like Breach got nerfed because they had too much abilities that can be saved to postplant Now imagine every agent gets twice of their original abilities You can tell things will be very very wrong even if you dont play valorant The way people approach preplant the way postplant plays out comps that specialize in postplant saving abilities tradeoff in saving abilities or using them for entry etc all will be different Most valorant players dont think about it just like how most players dont think about downtimeuptime but nuances like these matter a lot to games They are directly tied to the identity of the game even if they are not presented to people on a surface level

of her identity and all the intricacy around it the same go for all the other hero Hog getting punish for forget to reload soldier run out of bullet rein hide behind wall tracer die after recall with no blink etc be all important aspect for these individual hero and the game as a whole if everything be break nothing be break do not work because there be beauty in weakness and inconvenience Downtimeuptime be important in OW and the perk mention above be not healthy for the game because they tilt the balance between downtime and uptime People do not normally think about the concept of downtime and uptime when they re game so I will not blame you if you can not see the problem present here be an analogy with valorant that can help far explain the situation in valorant round be clearly split into preplant and postplant every agent have a limited amount of ability with only a few ability rechargable by time or by kill what happen in most round be that most of the ability will be use preplant for entry and postplant will have a lot less abiltie only special comp like deadlockvyse comp that specifically play for postplant can have most of their abiltiie save for postplant Characters like Breach get nerfe because they have too much ability that can be save to postplant now imagine every agent get twice of their original ability you can tell thing will be very very wrong even if you do not play valorant the way people approach preplant the way postplant play out comp that specialize in postplant save ability tradeoff in save ability or use they for entry etc all will be different Most valorant player do not think about it just like how most player do not think about downtimeuptime but nuance like these matter a lot to game they be directly tie to the identity of the game even if they be not present to people on a surface level change they be to change the identity of the game and to what degree would people realize the game they love be no long the game they love,perk system wrong philosophical level despite able save OW2 pt1 Perk system directly bloat character kit good thing break break statement sense game especially competitive like Overwatch 2

I dont like the perk system because despite what Blizzard claims theyre still playing it very safe The socalled spectacular changes that were supposed to break the perfect balance and bring some fun either just give back what Blizzard once took away or introduce completely useless perks or ones that have no real impact on gameplay The inconsistencies between heroes both in minor and major ones are laughable While Zarya turns into a killing machine and Tracer can blink 50 times a minute Genji just regenerates a tiny bit not to mention the perk that resets his double jump which already resets when he touches the ground Dont get me wrong its nice to see some changes but this feels like yet another poorly thoughtout dive into deep water For every perk that gives you a double slide theres one that gives enemies lifesteal and this supposedly faster gameplay doesnt really feel that way From what Ive observed the further we go into new competitive games the more developers tend to speed up the gameplay Players demand it sure but couldnt Blizzard have gone further Couldnt this new system actually introduce new mechanics instead of just recycling old ones Are they leaning more toward old fans who begged for Orisas shield to return or for nostalgic stimulation with Reapers original healing orbs Where a perk could offer more freedom to shape the playstyle players dream of we just get

Some perks seem to have fundamentally improved Heroes to eventually be removed They should stay as either permanent perks or somehow implemented into the actual kit I think perks like Pharahs ult movement Junos headshot Reapers Secondary Fire seem too fundamental to their playstyles Other perks are more just buffs or weakness mitigation like Ana double Nano or Tracer Blinks so they dont change how a Hero is played But Perks that fundamentally activate Heroes to being played better or different ways should really stay Edit Im talking about how theyre said every 6 months there will be new perks,Some perks seem to have fundamentally improved Heroes to eventually be removed They should stay as either permanent perks or somehow implemented into the actual kit I think perks like Pharahs ult movement Junos headshot Reapers Secondary Fire seem too fundamental to their playstyles Other perks are more just buffs or weakness mitigation like Ana double Nano or Tracer Blinks so they do nt change how a Hero is played But Perks that fundamentally activate Heroes to being played better or different ways should really stay Edit I m talking about how they re said every 6 months there will be new perks,some perk seem to have fundamentally improve Heroes to eventually be remove they should stay as either permanent perk or somehow implement into the actual kit I think perk like Pharahs ult movement Junos headshot Reapers Secondary Fire seem too fundamental to their playstyle other perk be more just buff or weakness mitigation like Ana double Nano or Tracer Blinks so they do not change how a Hero be play but Perks that fundamentally activate Heroes to be play well or different way should really stay Edit I m talk about how they re say every 6 month there will be new perk,perk fundamentally improve Heroes eventually remove stay permanent perk implement actual kit think perk like Pharahs ult movement Junos headshot Reapers Secondary Fire fundamental playstyle perk buff weakness mitigation like Ana double Nano Tracer Blinks change Hero play Perks fundamentally activate Heroes play different way stay Edit m talk 6 month new perk
Tracer perks needs changes And I have some ideas Listen I love our hyperactive time traveler shes the hardest character in the game and I understand that mastering her deserves results But theres a little problem with Tracers perks in that they dumb down her skill ceiling so I would like to propose some changes to some perks to fix this problem For the LvL 2 perks When Tracer takes a health pack she recovers a Blink This is OK it is if anything a quality of life change as a flanker The perk that increases the radius of pulse bomb is gonne now killing an enemy grants Tracer the effects of the old DPS passive and she reloads faster during 2 or 3 seconds Why Honestly Pulse Bomb is supposed to be balanced around the fact that being as hard as it it to use is the quickest ultimate you can get in the game I dont consider a good change to just make it easier to use And giving Tracer faster reload times gives her a more distinct effect while being a nice reference to the old passives For the LvL 3 Perks Tracer recovers all her blinks when she recalls But now theres a catch For every blink she recovers the next cooldown of Recall increases in one extra second to a Max of 3 seconds When Tracer recalls She gains temporary health when reappearing But now how much health she gets depends on the DISTANCE she traveled from the point she recalled to the point of origin The less distance the less over health she gets if you dont move at all during recall no over health for you Why I think Tracer having strong perks like this isnt inherently bad the thing that makes Perks so fun to me is that theyre based on the old Overwatch days of better crazy even if a little broken But theres some perks that are so damn good In this second case instead of just nerfing them I tried to give them a twist by making them more hard to get value from them as Tracer is supposed to be like I would love to hear your opinion about this or other ideas you have,Tracer perks needs changes And I have some

My selfish desire for a doomfist rework Doomfist since its launch trailer has been my favourite character both in loreflavour and gameplay Its the only real reason why i still care abour the game even if i barely play anymore However ive always felt that the hypermobile oneshotting niche it filled during OW1 and the hypermobile disruptor niche it fills in OW2 arent what we were promised I hoped for him to be a combo based brawler with a strong emphasis on ability spam rather than traditional FPS mechanics His mobility and techs are beautiful but its just not what i feel the character was MEANT to be So here is what I dream of doomfist one day becoming I want his powerblock and rocket punch to have as low a cool down as posible Dont know if we should make it a meter or an extremely short one or none at all The power block would be active essentially whenever you desire since it really isnt that strong of a defensive move compared to every other tank The meter fills like right now and you may choose to instantly use that charge for a cone knockback with low damage or to store it to charge your fist Every time to use power block the meter refills so you gotta be smart on how you use it since you cant stockpile it I want uncharged fist to have low range I want its range damage and CC to increase according to your block But when its not charged i want it to feel like a proper punch not to tickle the enemy but launch them 40 miles Again since its going to be spammable numbers should be tweaked Nobody uses rocket punchs basic movement anyway its always cancelled so the loss on base movement isnt a problem I like his passive It cements him as an ability centered combo character Its nice to have a tank with the damage HP mechanic that isnt broken by design Since power block is going to be available more often and fist can be spammed it sould obviously be lowered His basic gameplay loop revolves around him leaping and interweaving small fists and shotgun shots to wittle enemy health Whenever big damage comes bis way power block helps keep him alive with a potential reward of a beeg punche His leap will be the only long cooldown so it may be smart to save it as an escape tool once youve disrupted and brawled for a while I thought of this before the perks came out and im yet to try how they play But,My selfish desire for a doomfist rework Doomfist since its

mechanic his mobility and tech be beautiful but its just not what I feel the character be mean to be so here be what I dream of doomfist one day become I want his powerblock and rocket punch to have as low a cool down as posible do not know if we should make it a meter or an extremely short one or none at all the power block would be active essentially whenever you desire since it really be not that strong of a defensive move compare to every other tank the meter fill like right now and you may choose to instantly use that charge for a cone knockback with low damage or to store it to charge your fist every time to use power block the meter refill so you get to be smart on how you use it since you can not stockpile it I want uncharged fist to have low range I want its range damage and cc to increase accord to your block but when its not charge I want it to feel like a proper punch not to tickle the enemy but launch they 40 mile again since its go to be spammable number should be tweak nobody use rocket punchs basic movement anyway its always cancel so the loss on base movement be not a problem I like his passive it cement he as an ability center combo character its nice to have a tank with the damage HP mechanic that be not break by design since power block be go to be available more often and fist can be spamme it sould obviously be lower his basic gameplay loop revolve around he leap and interweave small fist and shotgun shot to wittle enemy health whenever big damage come bis way power block help keep he alive with a potential reward of a beeg punche his leap will be the only long cooldown so it may be smart to save it as an escape tool once you ve disrupt and brawl for a while I think of this before the perk come out and I m yet to try how they play but,selfish desire doomfist rework Doomfist launch trailer favourite character loreflavour gameplay real reason care abour game barely play anymore ve feel hypermobile oneshotting niche fill OW1 hypermobile disruptor niche fill OW2 promise hope combo base brawler strong emphasis ability spam traditional FPS mechanic mobility tech beautiful feel character mean dream doomfist day want powerblock rocket punch low cool posible know meter extremely short power block active essentially desire strong defensive compare tank meter fill like right choose instantly use charge cone knockback low damage store charge fist time use power block meter refill smart use stockpile want uncharged fist low range want range damage cc increase accord block charge want feel like proper punch tickle enemy launch 40 mile spammable number tweak use rocket punchs basic movement cancel loss base movement problem like passive cement ability center combo character nice tank damage HP mechanic break

Sombra is the only hero where their major perks make them worse to play You could also maybe argue Junkrat too since they do fib with muscle memory a bit but thats a rant for a diffirent guy Stack Overflow is just straight up terrible with the tradeoff never being worth it for 99 of matches Sucks for both the Sombra and her target all around And White Hack which isnt bad in principal and wouldve been the default choice if it wasnt so damn clunky to use and oftentimes a detriment instead of a bonus Also her minor ones are boring I get it Sombra sucks She isnt the most pleasant to play against and I agree that she should stay on the weaker side of the cast But at least give me something man A reason to fully use the fun brand new shiny mechanic and not just ignore it for half the match,Sombra is the only hero where their major perks make them worse to play You could also maybe argue Junkrat too since they do fib with muscle memory a bit but that s a rant for a diffirent guy Stack Overflow is just straight up terrible with the tradeoff never being worth it for 99 of matches Sucks for both the Sombra and her target all around And White Hack which is nt bad in principal and would ve been the default choice if it was nt so damn clunky to use and oftentimes a detriment instead of a bonus Also her minor ones are boring I get it Sombra sucks She is nt the most pleasant to play against and I agree that she should stay on the weaker side of the cast But at least give me something man A reason to fully use the fun brand new shiny mechanic and not just ignore it for half the match,Sombra be the only hero where their major perk make they bad to play you could also maybe argue Junkrat too since they do fib with muscle memory a bit but that s a rant for a diffirent guy Stack Overflow be just straight up terrible with the tradeoff never be worth it for 99 of match suck for both the Sombra and her target all around and White Hack which be not bad in principal and would ve be the default choice if it be not so damn clunky to use and oftentime a detriment instead of a bonus also her minor one be boring I get it Sombra suck she be not the most pleasant to play against and I agree that she should stay on the weak side of the cast but at least give I something man a reason to fully use the fun brand new shiny mechanic and not just ignore it for half the match,Sombra hero major perk bad play maybe argue Junkrat fib muscle memory bit s rant diffirent guy Stack Overflow straight terrible tradeoff worth 99 match suck Sombra target White Hack bad principal ve default choice damn clunky use oftentime detriment instead bonus minor boring Sombra suck pleasant play agree stay weak cast man reason fully use fun brand new shiny mechanic ignore half match
Sombra Perk Rework Ideas IMO all four of her works need a lot of work The problem with her minor perks is just heavy undertuning Compared to some other heroes having extremely powerful minors Ram Haz Ana Bap Pharah or just large buffs to their gameplans tracer ball health pack perks for ex she has two extremely situational things which are horrifically undertuned Viral Efficiency If youve landed a kill with your Virus it is extremely rare that youll actually have the other resources HP ammo etc to gain any advantage from having the perk Sombra is an assassin so the enemy youre killing is either isolated or youre going to have to get the fuck out of dodge the moment you finish the kill unless you want to get traded for it So mostly the perk only ends up making a difference during cleanup of fights youve already won Possible Improvements 1 Killing a target who has been hit by virus takes X seconds off of every cooldown Less damage oriented and more uptime oriented Having your TL come up faster because youve killed someone can meaningfully help you avoid getting traded after a kill and set up for the next hit much faster 2 Killing a target who has been hit by virus takes X seconds off of Viruss cooldown and refills Y Ammo Keeps the current idea but replenishes one more resource so she has a better chance of actually being able to keep fighting Ctrl Alt Escape This one is just horribly undertuned You generally dont want to be leaving at critical health because it means that catching a stray bullet on your way out is going to kill you It is also just a pathetically weak effect Even when you get it it is passive health regen It still takes you like 45 seconds to be able to fight again from critical Possible Improvements 1 Regenerate 100 HP in 2 seconds after using TL Much more flexible in potential uses much more powerful overall If they want the niche to be resetting to fight again this one would work 2 Increase velocity of the TL projectile Quite simply allow her to get further away from her enemies when she throws it Even a moderate increase would do a lot towards helping her get out of threat area and it is flexible because it can also be used for initiation sometimes 3 Overhealth on TL instantly decays when you unstealth If they want this to be a purely dedicated escape option giving her overhealth the moment she throws the TL until she comes out of cloak would make it much harder to chase her down and kill her I dont like it because it isnt very flexible but it would achieve that goal The problem with her Majors is more serious You know what my major perk choice is for Sombra I dont skill and I put up with the flashing shit in my HUD for the rest of the game In general she needs one perk which does not have a downside or major mechanical change to avoid situations where you just dont play with a major perk White Hat This thing has two major problems it is undertuned and it actively loses you fights by sabotaging your gameplay when it decides that your support strafing into your crosshair while flailing around is more important than interupting that death blossom anyway IMO This thing needs a higher power level to start with but it also needs them to either A commit to only being able to hack allies once youve taken the perk or B do serious UX work Ally hack would need to have a substantially higher power level in order to make up for losing one of her main abilities Possible Ideas for Ally only hack 1 Hacks enemies who deal more than X damage to teammates under the effect of White Hat One problem with the ability is that a lot of the time it is better to just hack and kill the person attacking your support than it is to hackheal your support This would fix that dilemma You hack the support standing in death blossom They get healed and the reaper gets almost instantly interupted on his next damage tick 2 Sombra gains Opportunists damage boost and wallhack on targets within LOS of her White Hat target Essentially the LOS of the person you Whitehat gives AOE hack without the silencing aspect You could either hack your supports to get damage boost on the divers or hack your Winston to get damage boost on the dive 3 Some other kind of buff for her allies ex cooldown reduction attack speed etc Im personally not a fan of this since it will turn her gameplay into allyhackgobrrrr but some kind of power increase is definitely needed if you take away hacking enemies Possible ideas for keeping both hacks 1 Give the option of setting different keybinds for ally and enemy hack in hero specific settings 2 Include an option to toggle between hack target types with a button in hero specific settings 3 Give more granular options on hack targetting in hero specific settings Straight up give us priority sliders for distance vs angle so we can tune it exactly as we want it Let us also set a relative priority on teammates and enemies Stack Overflow Delete this In its current form Overflow is just a bad pick 80 of the time because it forces Sombra too close to enemies However if they buff it to be more effective it will become completely obnoxious Nobody enjoys playing against long hack duration Sombra Long duration hack should be for EMP only Sombra straight up should not have any perks which make hack longer Possible full replacements of this perk 1 Double Translocator When throwing translocator Sombra drops a second one before teleporting She can press the key again to return to her original position within 4 seconds Cooldown mechanics work identically to Kirikos doubleTP 2 Precision assassin Opportunist no longer grants a 20 damage increase but instead grants Sombra a 25X headshot multiplier on hacked targets This is of course still reduced by Tank passive but it would make Lip OP again 3 Dramatic Entrance Translocator cooldown is increases substantially but Sombra now refunds ammo and releases a miniEMP when uncloaking MiniEMP has 13rd the normal radius thats like 8x less area I think and only hacks for the normal duration Anyway the exact ideas here arent exactly the point so much as that Sombra is the only hero in the game where I just dont skill a major perk and have to listen to the fucking annoying ping So blizzard here is one final idea if you cant figure sombra out Super Effective Instant Sombra Fix 1 Add a button to skip level up which removes the notification sound and flashing HUD element for a perk choice Can still press alt to pick if you chose just makes it stop notifying you Overall I think Id like to see 1 reducing all CDs on virus kill 2 higher translocator velocityrange 3 ally only whitehat which hacks enemies that damage your teammate and 4 double translocator I think this would make her interesting offer up new playstyles and avoid buffing hack duration or giving her infinite stealth The translocator major would give her a choice which doesnt actively detract in any way as you could just not press the button again and suffer no consequence while White Hat would be a major playstyle change,Sombra Perk Rework Ideas IMO all four of her works need a lot of work The problem with her minor perks is just heavy

gameplans tracer ball health pack perk for ex she have two extremely situational thing which be horrifically undertuned Viral Efficiency if you ve land a kill with your Virus it be extremely rare that you ll actually have the other resource HP ammo etc to gain any advantage from have the perk Sombra be an assassin so the enemy you re kill be either isolated or you re go to have to get the fuck out of dodge the moment you finish the kill unless you want to get trade for it so mostly the perk only end up make a difference during cleanup of fight you ve already win possible Improvements 1 kill a target who have be hit by virus take X second off of every cooldown Less damage orient and more uptime orient have your TL come up fast because you ve kill someone can meaningfully help you avoid getting trade after a kill and set up for the next hit much fast 2 kill a target who have be hit by virus take X second off of viruss cooldown and refill Y Ammo keep the current idea but replenish one more resource so she have a well chance of actually be able to keep fight Ctrl Alt Escape this one be just horribly undertuned you generally do not want to be leave at critical health because it mean that catch a stray bullet on your way out be go to kill you it be also just a pathetically weak effect even when you get it it be passive health regen it still take you like 45 second to be able to fight again from critical Possible Improvements 1 Regenerate 100 HP in 2 second after use TL much more flexible in potential use much more powerful overall if they want the niche to be reset to fight again this one would work 2 increase velocity of the TL projectile quite simply allow she to get far away from her enemy when she throw it even a moderate increase would do a lot towards help she get out of threat area and it be flexible because it can also be use for initiation sometimes 3 Overhealth on TL instantly decay when you unstealth if they want this to be a purely dedicated escape option give her overhealth the moment she throw the TL until she come out of cloak would make it much hard to chase she down and kill she I do not like it because it be not very flexible but it would achieve that goal the problem with her Majors be more serious you know what my major perk choice be for Sombra I do not skill and I put up with the flash shit in my HUD for the rest of the game in general she need one perk which do not have a downside or major mechanical change to avoid situation where you just do not play with a major perk White Hat this thing have two major problem it be undertuned and it actively lose you fight by sabotage your gameplay when it decide that your support strafe into your crosshair while flail around be more important than interupte that death blossom anyway imo this thing need a high power level to start with but it also need they to either a commit to only be able to hack ally once you ve take the perk or b do serious UX work Ally hack would need to have a substantially high power level in order to make up for lose one of her main ability possible idea for Ally only hack 1 Hacks enemy who deal more than x damage to teammate under the effect of White Hat one problem with the ability be that a lot of the time it be well to just hack and kill the person attack your support than it be to hackheal your support this would fix that dilemma you hack the support stand in death blossom they get heal and the reaper get almost instantly interupted on his next damage tick 2 Sombra gain opportunist damage boost and wallhack on target within LOS of her White Hat target essentially the LOS of the person you Whitehat give AOE hack without the silence aspect you could either hack your support to get damage boost on the diver or hack your Winston to get damage boost on the dive 3 some other kind of buff for her ally ex cooldown reduction attack speed etc I m personally not a fan of this since it will turn her gameplay into allyhackgobrrrr but some kind of power increase be definitely need if you take away hack enemy possible idea for keep both hack 1 give the option of set different keybind for ally and enemy hack in hero specific setting 2 include an option to toggle between hack target type with a button in hero specific setting 3 give more granular option on hack targetting in hero specific setting straight up give we priority slider for distance vs angle so we can tune it exactly as we want it let we also set a relative priority on teammate and enemy Stack Overflow Delete this in its current form overflow be just a bad pick 80 of the time because it force Sombra too close to enemy however if they buff it to be more effective it will become completely obnoxious nobody enjoy play against long hack duration Sombra Long duration hack should be for EMP only Sombra straight up should not have any perk which make hack long possible full replacement of this perk 1 Double Translocator when throw translocator Sombra drop a second one before teleport she can press the key again to return to her original position within 4 second Cooldown mechanic work identically to Kirikos doubletp 2 Precision assassin Opportunist no long grant a 20 damage increase but instead grant Sombra a 25x headshot multiplier on hack target this be of course still reduce by tank passive but it would make lip op again 3 Dramatic Entrance Translocator cooldown be increase substantially but Sombra now refund ammo and release a miniemp when uncloak MiniEMP have 13rd the normal radius that s like 8x less area I think and only hack for the normal duration anyway the exact idea here be not exactly the point so much as that Sombra be the only hero in the game where I just do not skill a major perk and have to listen to the fucking annoying ping so blizzard here be one final idea if you can not figure sombra out Super Effective Instant Sombra Fix 1 add a button to skip level up which remove the notification sound and flash HUD element for a perk choice can still press alt to pick if you chose just make it stop notify you overall I think I d like to see 1 reduce all cd on virus kill 2 high translocator velocityrange 3 ally only whitehat which hack enemy that damage your teammate and 4 double translocator I think this would make she interesting offer up new playstyle and avoid buff hack duration or give her infinite stealth the translocator major would give she a choice which do not actively detract in any way as you could just not press the button again and suffer no consequence while White Hat would be a major playstyle change,Sombra Perk Rework Ideas imo work need lot work problem minor perk heavy undertuning compare hero extremely powerful minor Ram Haz Ana Bap Pharah large buff gameplans tracer ball health pack perk ex extremely situational thing horrifically undertuned Viral Efficiency ve land kill Virus extremely rare ll actually resource HP ammo etc gain advantage perk Sombra assassin enemy kill isolated fuck dodge moment finish kill want trade perk end difference cleanup fight ve win possible Improvements 1 kill target hit virus X second cooldown damage orient uptime orient TL come fast ve kill meaningfully help avoid getting trade kill set hit fast 2 kill target hit virus X second viruss cooldown refill Y Ammo current idea replenish resource chance actually able fight Ctrl Alt Escape horribly undertuned generally want leave critical health mean catch stray bullet way kill pathetically weak effect passive health regen like 45 second able fight critical Possible Improvements 1 Regenerate 100 HP 2 second use TL flexible potential use powerful overall want niche reset fight work 2 increase velocity TL projectile simply allow far away enemy throw moderate increase lot help threat area flexible use initiation 3 Overhealth TL instantly decay unstealth want purely dedicated escape option overhealth moment throw TL come cloak hard chase kill like flexible achieve goal problem Majors know major perk choice Sombra skill flash shit HUD rest game general need perk downside major mechanical change avoid situation play major perk White Hat thing major problem undertuned actively lose fight sabotage gameplay decide support strafe crosshair flail important interupte death blossom imo thing need high power level start need commit able hack ally ve perk b UX work Ally hack need substantially high power level order lose main ability possible idea Ally hack 1 Hacks enemy deal x damage teammate effect White Hat problem ability lot time hack kill person attack support hackheal support fix dilemma hack support stand death blossom heal reaper instantly interupted damage tick 2 Sombra gain opportunist damage boost wallhack target LOS White Hat target essentially LOS person Whitehat AOE hack silence aspect hack support damage boost diver hack Winston damage boost dive 3 kind buff ally ex cooldown reduction attack speed etc m personally fan turn gameplay allyhackgobrrrr kind power increase definitely need away hack enemy possible idea hack 1 option set different keybind ally enemy hack hero specific setting 2 include option toggle hack target type button hero specific setting 3 granular option hack targetting hero specific setting straight priority slider distance vs angle tune exactly want let set relative priority teammate enemy Stack Overflow Delete current form overflow bad pick 80 time force Sombra close enemy buff effective completely obnoxious enjoy play long hack duration Sombra Long duration hack EMP Sombra straight perk hack long possible replacement perk 1 Double Translocator throw translocator Sombra drop second teleport press key return original position 4 second Cooldown mechanic work identically Kirikos doubletp 2 Precision assassin Opportunist long grant 20 damage increase instead grant Sombra 25x headshot multiplier hack target course reduce tank passive lip op 3 Dramatic Entrance Translocator cooldown increase substantially Sombra refund ammo release miniemp uncloak MiniEMP 13rd normal radius s like 8x area think hack normal duration exact idea exactly point Sombra hero game skill major perk listen fucking annoying ping blizzard final idea figure sombra Super Effective Instant Sombra Fix 1 add button skip level remove notification sound flash HUD element perk choice press alt pick chose stop notify overall think d like 1 reduce cd virus kill 2 high translocator velocityrange 3 ally whitehat hack enemy damage teammate 4 double translocator think interesting offer new playstyle avoid buff hack duration infinite stealth translocator major choice actively detract way press button suffer consequence White Hat major playstyle change

since his kit had very little decisionmaking to it Sure it has a bit of skill expression in aiming and placing the vortex properly but once you found a good target for those abilities there was never a reason to change your approach throughout the game But things are completely different with his major perks Nanite Repair gives you the option to either use Vortex traditionally as a spacethreatener that makes targets more vulnerable to your attacks or more defensively thrown close to you to extend your presence in the fight Vengeful Vortex seems like its solely designed to deal with flyers but it also allows you to more easily drop Vortex on snipers sitting on distant high ground or on a closer target you just want to pressure with the additional 50 damage Whichever one you choose depends on the overall state of the game and how you use either can change between team fights Thats exactly what he was missing before and he is a hundred times more fun to play now,Ramattras perks fixed him

A Guide to Archiving Overwatch Content on Twitch Before April 19th 2025 Hey rCOW this post is for educational purposes only This post was prompted by the recent call to action by uEsportToys where they brought to the communitys attention the changes to Twitchs terms of service that delete thousands of hours of archived Overwatch content from the past 9 years This includes channels like OGNEsports Overwatch APEX and other tournaments that have not been replicated anywhere else Since that post was made I have been slowly archiving the Overwatch Apex streams from the OGNEsports and FACEITOverwatch and I would like to share my methods so that others might join in and help preserve this era of Overwatch history #Step 1 First things first youll need to find a channel on Twitch that you would like to archive That might be a smaller tournament channel like BPL or a larger one like FACEITOverwatch #Step 2 Alright you have a channel you want to archive but you will need a client to download their broadcasts I would highly recommend TwitchDownloader which has a very nice GUI for Windows users This tool allows you to download entire VODs portions of VODs as well as the entire Twitch chat logs for each of those broadcasts or highlights #Step 3 You have the tool to download VODs but if you would like to move beyond manually copying and pasting video links into TwitchDownloader I have a little script that will extract all video links from a specified Twitch channel past broadcasts or highlights check the code comments It does require you to create an Application in the Twitch developer portal by following these steps 1 Click on Applications in the left sidebar after youve logged in 2 Click on Register Your Application 3 Give the application a unique name so you might have to be a little creative here Enter as the OAuth Redirect URL it doesnt really matter what you put in there but I found that to work for this Select any category I chose Other 4 Click Create 5 On the next page click on Manage next to your new application At the bottom of that screen you will see your Client ID and your Client Secret You might have to create a new one if you dont see one there As the name might imply dont share these with anyone else 6 Copy the contents of this page and paste them into Notepad Replace the yourclientid and yourclientsecret with these numbers and replace the user login with the channel name you would like to archive Save this file as something like twitchpy to somewhere like your Downloads folder 9 Make sure you have Python installed and then run the following commands after opening your Command Prompt cd Downloads or wherever you saved the py file python twitchpy This should save a list of all of the past broadcasts for that channel that are available If you would like to switch to highlights instead of past broadcasts change the archive on line 31 to highlight #Step 4 Copy these links and paste them into Twitch Downloader by going to the Task Queue tab and clicking URL list It will prompt you for things like whether you would like to download the VOD the chat and whether you would like to render the chat as a video You can mess around with the settings for that in the Chat Render tab Thats really all there is to it It should download the VODs in their source quality for your archiving pleasure The more people that we can have locally storing these pieces of Overwatch history the better #If you would like to check out my archive of the OGNEsports Overwatch APEX streams feel free to check out this

Ranked reset Dear Diary Anyone else feel like ranked resets are pretty annoying or just me Just to share my experience I slogged through lopsided matches throwers and leavers of diamond last season to return to my former peak ie masters 4 just one tricking tracer So there I was in m4 enjoying some of the tastiest games of all time Everyone basically understood the macro fundamentals of overwatch and the game began to settle down into more predictability and consistency from its former chaos in diamond I was so hyped to play in a masters 4 masters 2 lobby last season For reference I play in Korea If you check the leaderboards for last season youll see that this lobby is basically entirely top 500 if not very close to top 500 Im masters 4 70 pushing my peak about to break masters 3 playing against the best players Ive ever faced And holding my own Going 153 while the rest of my team has 78 kills max I know stats dont matter but Im trying to convey that I was proud that I was performing decently against people I thought would stomp me Then boom ranked reset Not even a hard reset its a soft reset that basically just demoted you 5 ranks Like all this champ streamers now in gm and me and many players I had met playing in masters lobbies last season now seen in diamond 4 Which would be fine if d4 just felt like the new m4 I only care about my progression But the problem is there are these new players or returning players that are really awful Like I swear and I beg you to bear with me Im not a teammate hater I hate blaming my teammates But guys these are like actual negative stats teammates or more than 1 death per minute I swear to god Im not tripping 😭 😭 idk what is going on but there are some games where I can go Im not even kidding 241 and my teammate is 813 and we lose And these arent one off scenarios This is like every game When theyre on the enemy team I win with utter and complete ease and when theyre on my team I just lose Its really one sided and you just end up with super big win streaks when you dont get these teammates and super big loss streaks when you do I swear this is not cope I couldnt have forgotten how to play at a masters level in 1 week I dont want to have to slog again overwatch please lord I just want to push my peak Stop throwing me back into the gulag Its not effective to learn the game when you arent pushing your level and feels so pointless and discouraging when you play the best game of your life but rein hold shield for me teammate is going 614 Edit to add the posts feels pretty salty and teammate blamey but I dont know how else to phrase this Im not trying to blame teammates Like I said I get these players on enemy teams too and they help me win as much as they help me lose Im just trying to say that these players clearly dont belong at this rank Love to my teammates and I wish the torb that went 711 nothing but the best in life I hope they become rich famous hot and hyper successful with a loving

The discussions about perks and S15 really shows how much bad faith there is in overwatch internet discourse Ive seen so many articles Reddit posts and comments YouTube thumbnails which basically boil down to Oh wow overwatch 2 is finally a fun and good game That discourse stems directly from the introduction of perks and the added depth and fun factor they provide But while I agree they are a great addition theyre not THAT much of a game changer Sojourn having 15 more bullets in her gun or even tracer regenerating blinks on recall are not what makes overwatch as a whole a great game This feels way more like perks are being used deliberately or not by a lot of people to try the game again with a somewhat open mind instead of being actively looking for the next thing to complain about and karmafarm But its such a shame honestly All these guys saying they are having a lot of fun with the game now probably would have been doing the exact same before its the same crisp gameplay thats been here since 2016 But people were just willing to ignore all that good stuff simply for the sake of internet circlejerk,The discussions about perks and S15 really shows how much bad faith there is in overwatch internet discourse I ve seen so many articles Reddit posts and comments YouTube thumbnails which basically boil down to Oh wow overwatch 2 is finally a fun and good game That discourse stems directly from the introduction of perks and the added depth and fun factor they provide But while I agree they are a great addition they re not THAT much of a game changer Sojourn having 15 more bullets in her gun or even tracer regenerating blinks on recall are not what makes overwatch as a whole a great game This feels way more like perks are being used deliberately or not by a lot of people to try the game again with a somewhat open mind instead of being actively looking for the next thing to complain about and karmafarm But its such a shame honestly All these guys saying they are having a lot of fun with the game now probably would have been doing the exact same before its the same crisp gameplay that s been here since 2016 But people were just willing to ignore all that good stuff simply for the sake of internet circlejerk,the discussion about perk and S15 really show how much bad faith there be in overwatch internet discourse I ve see so many article reddit post and comment YouTube thumbnail which basically boil down to oh wow overwatch 2 be finally a fun and good game that discourse stem directly from the introduction of perk and the add depth and fun factor they provide but while I agree they be a great addition they re not that much of a game changer Sojourn have 15 more bullet in her gun or even tracer regenerating blink on recall be not what make overwatch as a whole a great game this feel way more like perk be be use deliberately or not by a lot of people to try the game again with a somewhat open mind instead of be actively look for the next thing to complain about and karmafarm but its such a shame honestly all these guy say they be have a lot of fun with the game now probably would have be do the exact same before its the same crisp gameplay that s be here since 2016 but people be just willing to ignore all that good stuff simply for the sake of internet circlejerk,discussion perk S15 bad faith overwatch internet discourse ve article reddit post comment YouTube thumbnail basically boil oh wow overwatch 2 finally fun good game discourse stem directly introduction perk add depth fun factor provide agree great addition game changer Sojourn 15 bullet gun tracer regenerating blink recall overwatch great game feel way like perk use deliberately lot people try game somewhat open mind instead actively look thing complain karmafarm shame honestly guy lot fun game probably exact crisp gameplay s 2016 people willing ignore good stuff simply sake internet circlejerk

Why perk system is wrong on a philosophical level despite being able to save OW2 pt2 Hi same guy here This is the link to part 1 To sum up my points in the previous post perk system bloats characters kits and some perks mess up the uptimedowntime balance Here in this second post I am going to further explain why perk system is bad through the lens of hero fantasies including loreleaning fantasies and ingame fantasies Yes perks at least some are dangerous to hero fantasies Lets talk about loreleaning fantasies first This word does not really exist so here is my operational definition of this word Loreleaning fantaies mean characters creating an overall vibe for players by doing things that make sense in the context of the story For example the fantasy of Reinhardt is established when he swings the hammer because he is supposed to be able to swing his hammer based on his backstory the fantasy of Moira is established when she gains hp by doing dmg because she is the evil scientist who can rebuild humanbody through chemicals the fantasy of Cassidy is established when players hit 2 headshots and delete a player because he is a sharpshooter lorewise The way some perks mess with it is by giving characters features outside of their story personality and character One of the examples is Hanzos Sonic Disruption the one that allows Hanzo to HACK health packs Storywise Hanzo has never been a hacker He has been a martial artswordbow master ever since the existence of the character Personalitywise he even has a voiceline with Cassidy on how both of them only use retro weapons It makes no sense to make Hanzo capable of hacking things It goes directly against both his backstory and his character Another example is Tracers blink packs the one that gives her blink charge upon taking health packs Tracers blinks has never had anything to do with getting healed or anything related to it Her blinks are the results of Winstons stablizer and Tracer her own timerelated superpower

Blizzard Season 15 AMA Full questionanswer list Original thread As a refresher these were the devs that answered questions Alec Dawson Lead Gameplay Designer Kenny Hudson Senior Game Producer Scott Kennedy Hero Designer AKA Custa former OWL player and talent HyPn0MaN Which perks had the highest impact on hero performance Will perks have a higher priority in terms of balance than base hero perks or will we see a combination of both going forward Alec Some of the winners so far have been Ana Bastion Pharah Ramattra and Winston When it comes to individual perks Ramattras Vengeful Vortex Maugas Firewalker Zaryas Energy Lance and Soldier 76s Agility training have all been quite impactful Its important though to look at the combination of your Minor and Major perks what rank thresholds players are using them at and how quickly a hero is gaining their perks Theres still quite a bit for us to dig through there In the immediate we mostly plan on balancing perks in order to make them feel more impactful There will still be some core kit tuning alongside that but theres still a meaningful amount of change we want to inject into the system throughout the next few patches Tuning to perks and actual perk swaps hoping for some in 160 are included in that Triskan Clash can be really fun when the stars align Anything you can share about what you plan to do with the mode in the future I was really looking forward to see the old 2CP maps reworked Oh and speaking of old maps any hope for Gothenburg to get a second life one day Alec Like you I also believe Clash is awesome when it all comes together We actually spent a good amount of time on Clashs scoring before we made the decision to pull it from Competitive Even with scoring changes we believed the mode needed some fundamental geo changes to points AE to perform better as a Competitive mode Currently we are experimenting with building another Clash map from the ground up with a different approach to the layout to see if that solves some of the core issues the mode has Thats all very early but hopefully some significant geo changes along with scoring changes can get Clash into a great spot banethor88 Kudos to the dev team for trying something so different For me it seems to be a hit already and I cant wait to get my hands on stadium 1 Chicken or egg question did Junkenstein revenges success serve as the spark for building a new game mode with talents more permanently into the game Or was this always in the back of mind given the amount of work that has gone into talents since OW2s development 2 What was the thinking behind limiting perks down to just 2X2 choices and is this something that you think could change in the future I personally really enjoyed how more choices really lead to different early and late game experiences Alec 1 Actually neither The true impetus for this was our need for a game system layer to introduce more change into the core game Having some talents to pull from was nice to have but a large majority of the perks were built for the perk system specifically The team had gotten really great at expanding kits so there was plenty of good experience for us to bring good learnings into building perks Junkensteins Lab gave us more signal for Stadium and how much we could expand the bounds of an Overwatch match while still making it feel like Overwatch 2 We played with a number of different iterations Originally we had three levels but there was no choice didnt feel very different Some iterations later we gave players their Minor Perks passively but you had a choice between two Major Perks later on in the game We really liked the choice that gave so decided to bring it in earlier at the Minor Perk level Overall we felt this was the right amount of change to introduce initially We were changing some of fundamentals of how Overwatch worked and were trying to measure how much we could disrupt that Maybe we couldve gone even farther but I think we are in a good place for now and with time well see how far the playerbase wants us to take systems like this ApostLeOW How does the team decided who gets the fun perks like pharah Kiriko ana who gets the new ability perks bastion orisa torbjorn and who just gets number buffs Reaper Genji Are the number buffs just placeholders with plans to go more extreme in the future to match the other heroes Alec Well the goal overall is to make fun perks for every hero That can be more difficult on certain heroes though as boosting certain elements of their kits can cause issues Currently the number buff perks are some of the perks we like the least and plan on changing a handful of those over time This initial launch has given us plenty of signal on which perk combinations players find compelling and which ones they dont Think its important for us to stay true to our values for Minor and Major perks Your Minor Perks are supposed to be lighter nice little upgrades Your Major Perks are supposed to be transformative We have some work to hit that goal for all of the heroes and offering more transformative Major Perks RobManfredsFixer Do you view perks as a way to limit the counterpicking and power spikes of certain heroes If so do you think they have shown early signs of achieving that and what adjustments would you make going forward Any examples of heroes youd want to shore up in that respect Alec We did want to add more friction to counterswapping and weve seen that drop quite a bit since Season 15s launch Itll be some time before players settle on how much less they want to counterswap but in Ranked Role Queue weve seen players swap about 25 less and more so at the highest ranks Masters players swap much more than the ranks below that For power spikes the goal of the perk system isnt to limit power spikes We actually introduced more power spikes and hopefully more texture to your individual heros moment to moment gameplay through the perks system We think a number of our heroes needed bigger moments than they had previously Going forward we are looking at raising up some of the less impactful perks and making sure you feel theres a real choice between your Minors and Majors We have a lot of opportunity to make that choice more interesting by cutting out some of perks players arent gravitating towards Things like Roadhogs increased Pig Pen throw distance No32 In the Spotlight Alec mentioned a refresh of the perks in the middle of the year Does that mean 4 brand new perks for everyone Saw someone mention Aaron said something along those lines but couldnt find where Or is it more like a few perks will be changed out or tweaked if desperately needed here and there before the refresh and the refresh is more thorough for perks that are less lopsided and not 4 brand new perks for everyone Alec The goal there would be that every hero gets at least one new perk to play with Still scoping out what that refresh would look like for Season 18 but somewhere around 2550 of the perks changing some being completely new and some receiving significant tuning If we have perks that players really love we dont want to immediately remove those and the refresh would be looking at perks that are more middling in interest Wed also like to evaluate how the perks system functions overall at that point too That could include changes to the catchup mechanics gain rates or even a starting level choice Those are fairly early discussions though and how this season goes will give us good insight of where to take perks next OnceToldTale What were some interesting perks that the team scrapped along the way Alec We played with a variety of movement perks for heroes that dont have much mobility We wanted to see if we could do a movement perk for Torbjorn I think it only lasted a playtest or two but Torbjorn could launch himself off of his turret by double jumping on it And the idea was that if you had the Sticky Turret you could change the angle of that leap and catapult yourself into backlines Maybe we will come back to that one day was certainly silly Nobbs89 Are there any ideas to make Mystery Heroes mode less stomping with new perks Currently perk system is another advantage that a winning team have compare to the team whos currently loosing I know its just a noncompetitive mode with no big priority although it has a huge playerbase Alec We have a fix for this coming next week actually Youll get two random perks one Minor and one Major each time you spawn Conflux Whats the overall design goalspillars for perks For some heroes perks seem to be covering weakness they may have Pharahs Drift thrusters or Reapers Dire Triggers while other perks seem to allow players more skill expression Sigmas Massive Impact or Anas Biotic bounce and some perks just seem odd or unfitting for the hero Sombras White Hat or Moiras Contamination Is there a set philosophy for perks that can be shared with the community Because it seems like perks are trying to solve a lot of problems in the sandbox Alec Perks are mainly about creating new things for your heroes to do increasing situational viability and giving you more agency over your inmatch experience For that goal of increasing the amount of situations in which a hero can be viable That can come through via shoring up weaknesses against certain heroes that can also come through by adding mobility so certain heroes can be played on more maps That goal led to perks like Junkrats Frag Cannon Sigmas Levitation and many more For perks like Sombras White Hat that is fulfilling a particular hero fantasy that many players wanted us to lean into and we think thats an interesting opportunity the perks system creates Over time well see how players respond to some of those more off the wall ones MetastableToChaos Very important question Will the new heroes since OW2s release be getting dance emotes Kenny I dont know when everyones Dance emotes are coming in but I can confirm that Rammattra is up next and soon tm SonOfGarry Are perks going to start rotating next season or are you going to wait and let the current batch simmer for a bit before changing them Bouncing off of that if you are looking at specific underperformingless interesting perks now which ones are on the potential chopping block a lot of my friends have noted the extra throw range on HogJunk trap as being quite weak Finally do you have any desire to ever add another level to perks either something in between minor and major or even something above major Kenny Were going to start rotating in some new perks in Season 16 but before we get there weve got a bunch of balance changes and tweaks coming in the Season 15 midcycle patch and there are good things coming for some underperforming perks Things like Hog Toss now increasing the damage of Pig Pen Junos double jump reset perk is also going to increase the duration of glide boost On the other end of the spectrum Bastions self repair resource meter is coming back We did a ton of iteration on how many levels perks should come with There were versions with 2 levels up through I think 4 and even one where you eventually had all minor and major perks 3 levels has been the sweet spot for a while but thats not to say the system cant evolve Still a bit early but its a system that can evolve if need be ModWilliam Was preselecting perks perk presets ever considered Kenny We did discuss the idea of preselecting perks and the original design even had an interface for them as a loadout in the hero gallery But once we started playtesting the abilities themselves there were a lot of situations where wed want to go with a different perk based on the situation at hand Being locked into a choice made prior to really being 100 on what you would want to choose felt like a worse option than always giving yourself options Thats not to say this couldnt change as people get used to the choices and their playstyles with perks become a bit more cemented though Cryptographer What is a primary weapon archetype you either want to fit in that you havent yet or think is at the very least under explored Kenny The one weapon that always comes up during the whats next discussion is the flame thrower Wed love to get one in but its gotta be epic ModWilliam Do we have any stats on which perk selections are the most onesided Eg one perk is picked over the other 90 of the time Scott We do have stats that show perk selection rates per hero I would say its variable depending on the hero and the rank that theyre being selected In general when a perk has an incredibly high pick rate its due to the other option not being enticing For example Roadhogs Minor Hog Toss isnt picked very often compared to Scrap Hook Other options like Ramattras Void Surge is a cool perk to play with that increases the heroes damage so its much preferred over the simpler defensive option Prolonged Barrier Overall the perk selection rates that are onesided are the ones you would expect and were using these stats and feedback to identify which perks need to be either balanced or changed in future patches Brutalrogue99 Are there any perks that youve seen a lot of praise for that you think you could potentially incorporate into the heros base kit Scott There arent any current plans to implement specific perks into hero kits but there are perks that have helped heroes in ways that could lead to changes in the future I think the biggest example of this would be Bastion The perks have helped fill in some of the holes in their kit For example Armored Artillery making the ultimate more dynamic Smart Bomb helping Bastions lack of mobility Self Repair aiding survivability issues a resource limitation is coming in the midseason patch These perks have made the hero both better overall but much more fun to play as well This was some of the major goals perks were trying to accomplish but I can see us taking some parts of perks and putting them into base kits as heroes change in the future CaptRavage This is for custa what was the though process behind giving ana headshots despite the fact you can not hit crits Scott Good thing for those who cant hit headshots like me we have double nano boost MountainApe following up on the above comment And perhaps more seriously Scott how many shoeys have you done while on the campus and how many team members have you convinced to join you Scott not enough so zero RobManfredsFixer Which perks too good or too bad are you monitoring the most Do you plan on fully replacing perks every 6 months12 months or would you rather keep the ones that are working adjust the ones that are almost there and swing for the fences by replacing the rest Scott There are definitely some on the radar that were keeping an eye on Obviously Tracers Major perk Flashback was one that we were wary of and are looking to see how impactful this perk can be Mobility perks like Zaryas Minor JumpUps this gives her a LOT of vertical mobility and is very strong on some maps but its pick rate varies dramatically depending on the rank There is a list of perks that have been underperforming both in win and pick rate that were actively looking at to make balance changes or even replace them starting in Season 16 The goal is to make every set of Minor and Major perks feel like there is a choice to be made depending on your playstyle the map or how the match is going If a perk feels like its always the right choice or the wrong choice then we want to make changes mizliz0 Hi this question is for Custa How are you so smart talented and amazing at your job Delete this part before you post the 20 Paypal and future Hanzo skin will be sent to your account But more seriously what are the developers favorite perks Not necessarily the best ones but their favorites Scott Thank you for your kind and honest question I personally had the most fun with Craftsman if you havent tried chasing your pinning Reinhardt to give him some armor its a lot of fun Other notable mentions would be Pharahs Concussive Implosion or Zaryas Jump Ups SuperSnivMatt Howdy Wanted to ask how the team decides when to strictly buff an ability versus when to give it a drawback Stuff like Sombras lockout duration increasing but decreasing her hack range by 30 and Mercys Flash Heal being tied to Res where using Flash Heal means you cant Res for 15 seconds and using Res mean you cant Flash Heal for 30 But then we see Tracer get all her blinks back on Recall as a massive boost despite no drawback like freezing her Blink CD or increasing her Recall CD Do you see yourselves introducing drawbacks to more perks or removingreducing existing ones to shake up underover preforming perks Scott When first ideating on perks the team included more perks that had a strong benefit but a drawback It was found that in some situations it could feel worse to play a perk even if the benefit was strong This can be seen currently with Sombras Major Stack Overflow We wanted to give players an option to be able to increase the lockout duration to secure more kills but reduce the range to make it riskier Weve received a lot of feedback that this perk doesnt feel good to use or play against so were planning on making a balance change to help and potentially replace it in the future We want to avoid situations like these in the future and in the instance we do have a perk that has a drawback we want to ensure that the other perk option doesnt also have a drawback so that theres always a beneficial option Re1nForce Im curious what the upper limitations are of perks as it relates to hero design and hero identity For example I think Mercy is a good example of a hero that does not have the same level of skill expression as a Tracer obviously just as an example would there be a world in which Mercy would receive a perk that could potentially elevate Mercys skill expression in exchange for more impact Additionally do you view perks as seasonal In which for example extreme example one season of Overwatch Mercy might lean into the damage boost aspect whereas in future seasons for the purpose of changing things up Mercy might even get a perk in which she can speed boost teammates instead I think this could potentially be a pretty dramatic but fun way to change up the game and help some heroes to still be played but not conventionally fitting into certain compositions but perhaps in your eyes its a bit extreme for the purpose that Mercys kit is supposed to serve Scott Hey Jonny For the first round of perks we were focused on adding perks that enhance or change the way that you play heroes In the future we could implement more transformative perks that would add skill expression or change the style in which you would currently play a hero I wouldnt say that perks have seasonal themes in which they will be designed to play a hero a certain way but weve learnt a lot about what perks are the most interesting and fun while also seeing the impact that they can have on a heroes winplay rate Zakainu Now that perks are in players hands what is your approach going to be moving forward when it comes to balancing and interating on them Are you planning on radically changing perks in the future and are you currently looking at adjusting the perks that are overunderperforming when it comes to pick rates In regards to Stadium Im very excited to try it Can you shed some light on the regularity with which we can expect to see heroes added to Stadium I would love to see what crazy upgrades you guys have in mind for Wrecking Ball Scott For now the primary goal is to focus on adjusting the perks that are underperformingoverperforming We will have a balance pass coming through in the Season 15 Midseason patch and will be swapping out some perks that havent been performing well in Season 16 Pick and win rates are important factors in deciding what needs to be changed but there is also a lot of great feedback weve received about perks that dont feel good to use or play against I wouldnt say there are radical changes to perks in the near future but we will be working to ensure perks feel good to use for all heroes BassSlut Will changing perks mid game ever be an option Scott We want it to feel like youre making a meaningful choice when you select your perk and when alliesenemies select their perk you understand what to expect on that hero for the match We understand that there is an issue with people accidentally selecting a perk and being unable to change it this is something were keeping an eye on to see if theres something that can be done to help this I wont say that it will never be an option to swap your heroes perks in the future but there are currently no plans to add changing perks mid game,Blizzard Season 15 AMA Full questionanswer list Original thread As a refresher these were the devs that answered questions Alec Dawson Lead Gameplay Designer Kenny Hudson Senior Game Producer Scott Kennedy Hero Designer AKA Custa former OWL player and talent HyPn0MaN Which perks had the highest impact on hero performance Will perks have a higher priority in terms of balance than base hero perks or will we see a combination of both going forward Alec Some of the winners so far have been Ana Bastion Pharah Ramattra and Winston When it comes to individual perks Ramattras Vengeful Vortex Maugas Firewalker Zaryas Energy Lance and Soldier 76s Agility training have all been quite impactful Its important though to look at the combination of your Minor and Major perks what rank thresholds players are using them at and how quickly a hero is gaining their perks There s still quite a bit for us to dig through there In the immediate we mostly plan on balancing perks in order to make them feel more impactful There will still be some core kit tuning alongside that but there s still a meaningful amount of change we want to inject into the system throughout the next few patches Tuning to perks and actual perk swaps hoping for some in 160 are included in that Triskan Clash can be really fun when the stars align Anything you can share about what you plan to do with the mode in the future I was really looking forward to see the old 2CP maps reworked Oh and speaking of old maps any hope for Gothenburg to get a second life one day Alec Like you I also believe Clash is awesome when it all comes together We actually spent a good amount of time on Clashs scoring before we made the decision to pull it from Competitive Even with scoring changes we believed the mode needed some fundamental geo changes to points AE to perform better as a Competitive mode Currently we are experimenting with building another Clash map from the ground up with a different approach to the layout to see if that solves some of the core issues the mode has That s all very early but hopefully some significant geo changes along with scoring changes can get Clash into a great spot banethor88 Kudos to the dev team for trying something so different For me it seems to be a hit already and I ca nt wait to get my hands on stadium 1 Chicken or egg question did Junkenstein revenges success serve as the spark for building a new game mode with talents more permanently into the game Or was this always in the back of mind given the amount of work that has gone into talents since OW2s development 2 What was the thinking behind limiting perks down to just 2X2 choices and is this something that you think could change in the future I personally really enjoyed how more choices really lead to different early and late game experiences Alec 1 Actually neither The true impetus for this was our need for a game system layer to introduce more change into the core game Having some talents to pull from was nice to have but a large majority of the perks were built for the perk system specifically The team had gotten really great at expanding kits so there was plenty of good experience for us to bring good learnings into building perks Junkensteins Lab gave us more signal for Stadium and how much we could expand the bounds of an Overwatch match while still making it feel like Overwatch 2 We played with a number of different iterations Originally we had three levels but there was no choice did nt feel very different Some iterations later we gave players their Minor Perks passively but you had a choice between two Major Perks later on in the game We really liked the choice that gave so decided to bring it in earlier at the Minor Perk level Overall we felt this was the right amount of change to introduce initially We were changing some of fundamentals of how Overwatch worked and were trying to measure how much we could disrupt that Maybe we could ve gone even farther but I think we are in a good place for now and with time well see how far the playerbase wants us to take systems like this ApostLeOW How does the team decided who gets the fun perks like pharah Kiriko ana who gets the new ability perks bastion orisa torbjorn and who just gets number buffs Reaper Genji Are the number buffs just placeholders with plans to go more extreme in the future to match the other heroes Alec Well the goal overall is to make fun perks for every hero That can be more difficult on certain heroes though as boosting certain elements of their kits can cause issues Currently the number buff perks are some of the perks we like the least and plan on changing a handful of those over time This initial launch has given us plenty of signal on which perk combinations players find compelling and which ones they do nt Think its important for us to stay true to our values for Minor and Major perks Your Minor Perks are supposed to be lighter nice little upgrades Your Major Perks are supposed to be transformative We have some work to hit that goal for all of the heroes and offering more transformative Major Perks RobManfredsFixer Do you view perks as a way to limit the counterpicking and power spikes of certain heroes If so do you think they have shown early signs of achieving that and what adjustments would you make going forward Any examples of heroes you d want to shore up in that respect Alec We did want to add more friction to counterswapping and we ve seen that drop quite a bit since Season 15s launch It ll be some time before players settle on how much less they want to counterswap but in Ranked Role Queue we ve seen players swap about 25 less and more so at the highest ranks Masters players swap much more than the ranks below that For power spikes the goal of the perk system is nt to limit power spikes We actually introduced more power spikes and hopefully more texture to your individual heros moment to moment gameplay through the perks system We think a number of our heroes needed bigger moments than they had previously Going forward we are looking at raising up some of the less impactful perks and making sure you feel there s a real choice between your Minors and Majors We have a lot of opportunity to make that choice more interesting by cutting out some of perks players are nt gravitating towards Things like Roadhogs increased Pig Pen throw distance No32 In the Spotlight Alec mentioned a refresh of the perks in the middle of the year Does that mean 4 brand new perks for everyone Saw someone mention Aaron said something along those lines but could nt find where Or is it more like a few perks will be changed out or tweaked if desperately needed here and there before the refresh and the refresh is more thorough for perks that are less lopsided and not 4 brand new perks for everyone Alec The goal there would be that every hero gets at least one new perk to play with Still scoping out what that refresh would look like for Season 18 but somewhere around 2550 of the perks changing some being completely new and some receiving significant tuning If we have perks that players really love we do nt want to immediately remove those and the refresh would be looking at perks that are more middling in interest We d also like to evaluate how the perks system functions overall at that point too That could include changes to the catchup mechanics gain rates or even a starting level choice Those are fairly early discussions though and how this season goes will give us good insight of where to take perks next OnceToldTale What were some interesting perks that the team scrapped along the way Alec We played with a variety of movement perks for heroes that do nt have much mobility We wanted to see if we could do a movement perk for Torbjorn I think it only lasted a playtest or two but Torbjorn could launch himself off of his turret by double jumping on it And the idea was that if you had the Sticky Turret you could change the angle of that leap and catapult yourself into backlines Maybe we will come back to that one day was certainly silly Nobbs89 Are there any ideas to make Mystery Heroes mode less stomping with new perks Currently perk system is another advantage that a winning team have compare to the team who s currently loosing I know its just a noncompetitive mode with no big priority although it has a huge playerbase Alec We have a fix for this coming next week actually You ll get two random perks one Minor and one Major each time you spawn Conflux What s the overall design goalspillars for perks For some heroes perks seem to be covering weakness they may have Pharahs Drift thrusters or Reapers Dire Triggers while other perks seem to allow players more skill expression Sigmas Massive Impact or Anas Biotic bounce and some perks just seem odd or unfitting for the hero Sombras White Hat or Moiras Contamination Is there a set philosophy for perks that can be shared with the community Because it seems like perks are trying to solve a lot of problems in the sandbox Alec Perks are mainly about creating new things for your heroes to do increasing situational viability and giving you more agency over your inmatch experience For that goal of increasing the amount of situations in which a hero can be viable That can come through via shoring up weaknesses against certain heroes that can also come through by adding mobility so certain heroes can be played on more maps That goal led to perks like Junkrats Frag Cannon Sigmas Levitation and many more For perks like Sombras White Hat that is fulfilling a particular hero fantasy that many players wanted us to lean into and we think that s an interesting opportunity the perks system creates Over time well see how players respond to some of those more off the wall ones MetastableToChaos Very important question Will the new heroes since OW2s release be getting dance emotes Kenny I do nt know when everyones Dance emotes are coming in but I can confirm that Rammattra is up next and soon tm SonOfGarry Are perks going to start rotating next season or are you going to wait and let the current batch simmer for a bit before changing them Bouncing off of that if you are looking at specific underperformingless interesting perks now which ones are on the potential chopping block a lot of my friends have noted the extra throw range on HogJunk trap as being quite weak Finally do you have any desire to ever add another level to perks either something in between minor and major or even something above major Kenny Were going to start rotating in some new perks in Season 16 but before we get there we ve got a bunch of balance changes and tweaks coming in the Season 15 midcycle patch and there are good things coming for some underperforming perks Things like Hog Toss now increasing the damage of Pig Pen Junos double jump reset perk is also going to increase the duration of glide boost On the other end of the spectrum Bastions self repair resource meter is coming back We did a ton of iteration on how many levels perks should come with There were versions with 2 levels up through I think 4 and even one where you eventually had all minor and major perks 3 levels has been the sweet spot for a while but that s not to say the system ca nt evolve Still a bit early but its a system that can evolve if need be ModWilliam Was preselecting perks perk presets ever considered Kenny We did discuss the idea of preselecting perks and the original design even had an interface for them as a loadout in the hero gallery But once we started playtesting the abilities themselves there were a lot of situations where we d want to go with a different perk based on the situation at hand Being locked into a choice made prior to really being 100 on what you would want to choose felt like a worse option than always giving yourself options That s not to say this could nt change as people get used to the choices and their playstyles with perks become a bit more cemented though Cryptographer What is a primary weapon archetype you either want to fit in that you have nt yet or think is at the very least under explored Kenny The one weapon that always comes up during the what s next discussion is the flame thrower We d love to get one in but its got ta be epic ModWilliam Do we have any stats on which perk selections are the most onesided Eg one perk is picked over the other 90 of the time Scott We do have stats that show perk selection rates per hero I would say its variable depending on the hero and the rank that they re being selected In general when a perk has an incredibly high pick rate its due to the other option not being enticing For example Roadhogs Minor Hog Toss is nt picked very often compared to Scrap Hook Other options like Ramattras Void Surge is a cool perk to play with that increases the heroes damage so its much preferred over the simpler defensive option Prolonged Barrier Overall the perk selection rates that are onesided are the ones you would expect and were using these stats and feedback to identify which perks need to be either balanced or changed in future patches Brutalrogue99 Are there any perks that you ve seen a lot of praise for that you think you could potentially incorporate into the heros base kit Scott There are nt any current plans to implement specific perks into hero kits but there are perks that have helped heroes in ways that could lead to changes in the future I think the biggest example of this would be Bastion The perks have helped fill in some of the holes in their kit For example Armored Artillery making the ultimate more dynamic Smart Bomb helping Bastions lack of mobility Self Repair aiding survivability issues a resource limitation is coming in the midseason patch These perks have made the hero both better overall but much more fun to play as well This was some of the major goals perks were trying to accomplish but I can see us taking some parts of perks and putting them into base kits as heroes change in the future CaptRavage This is for custa what was the though process behind giving ana headshots despite the fact you can not hit crits Scott Good thing for those who ca nt hit headshots like me we have double nano boost MountainApe following up on the above comment And perhaps more seriously Scott how many shoeys have you done while on the campus and how many team members have you convinced to join you Scott not enough so zero RobManfredsFixer Which perks too good or too bad are you monitoring the most Do you plan on fully replacing perks every 6 months12 months or would you rather keep the ones that are working adjust the ones that are almost there and swing for the fences by replacing the rest Scott There are definitely some on the radar that were keeping an eye on Obviously Tracers Major perk Flashback was one that we were wary of and are looking to see how impactful this perk can be Mobility perks like Zaryas Minor JumpUps this gives her a LOT of vertical mobility and is very strong on some maps but its pick rate varies dramatically depending on the

Scrap Hook other option like Ramattras Void Surge be a cool perk to play with that increase the hero damage so its much preferred over the simple defensive option Prolonged Barrier Overall the perk selection rate that be oneside be the one you would expect and be use these stat and feedback to identify which perk need to be either balanced or change in future patch Brutalrogue99 be there any perk that you ve see a lot of praise for that you think you could potentially incorporate into the heros base kit Scott there be not any current plan to implement specific perk into hero kit but there be perk that have help hero in way that could lead to change in the future I think the big example of this would be Bastion the perk have help fill in some of the hole in their kit for example Armored Artillery make the ultimate more dynamic Smart Bomb help Bastions lack of mobility Self Repair aid survivability issue a resource limitation be come in the midseason patch these perk have make the hero both well overall but much more fun to play as well this be some of the major goal perk be try to accomplish but I can see we take some part of perk and put they into base kit as hero change in the future CaptRavage this be for custa what be the though process behind give ana headshot despite the fact you can not hit crit Scott Good thing for those who can not hit headshot like I we have

be wary of and be look to see how impactful this perk can be Mobility perk like Zaryas Minor JumpUps this give she a LOT of vertical mobility and be very strong on some map but its pick rate vary dramatically depend on the rank there be a list of perk that have be underperform both in win and pick rate that be actively look at to make balance change or even replace they start in Season 16 the goal be to make every set of Minor and major perk feel like there be a choice to be make depend on your playstyle the map or how the match be go if a perk feel like its always the right choice or the wrong choice then we want to make change mizliz0 hi this question be for Custa how be you so smart talented and amazing at your job Delete this part before you post the 20 Paypal and future Hanzo skin

the most fun with Craftsman if you have not try chase your pinning Reinhardt to give he some armor its a lot of fun other notable mention would be Pharahs Concussive Implosion or Zaryas Jump Ups SuperSnivMatt Howdy want to ask how the team decide when to strictly buff an ability versus when to give it a drawback stuff like Sombras lockout duration increase but decrease her hack range by 30 and Mercys Flash Heal be tie to Res where use Flash Heal mean you can not Res for 15 second and use Res mean you can not Flash Heal for 30 but then we see Tracer get all her blink back on Recall as a massive boost despite no drawback like freeze her Blink cd or increase her Recall cd do you see yourself introduce drawback to more perk or removingreduce exist one to shake up underover preform perk Scott when first ideate on perk the team include more perk that have a strong benefit but a drawback it be find that in some situation it could feel bad to play a perk even if the benefit be strong this can be see currently with Sombras Major Stack Overflow we want to give player an option to be able to increase the lockout duration to secure more kill but reduce the range to make it risky we ve receive a lot of feedback that this perk do not feel good to use or play against so be plan on make a balance change to help and potentially replace it in the future we want to avoid situation like these in the future and in the instance we do have a perk that have a drawback we want to ensure that the other perk option do not also have a drawback so that there s always a beneficial option Re1nForce I m curious what the upper limitation be of perk as it relate to hero design and hero identity for example I think Mercy be a good example of a hero that do not have the same level of skill expression as a Tracer obviously just as an example would there be a world in which Mercy would receive a perk that could potentially elevate Mercys skill expression in exchange for more impact additionally do you view perk as seasonal in which for example extreme example one season of Overwatch Mercy might lean into the damage boost aspect whereas in future season for the purpose of change thing up Mercy might even get a perk in which she can speed boost teammate instead I think this could potentially be a pretty dramatic but fun way to change up the game and help some hero to still be play but not conventionally fitting into certain composition but perhaps in your eye its a bit extreme for the purpose that Mercys kit be suppose to serve Scott hey Jonny for the first round of perk we be focus on add perk that enhance or change the way that you play hero in the future we could implement more transformative perk that would add skill expression or change the style in which you

Blizzard Season 15 AMA Full questionanswer list Original thread As a refresher these were the devs that answered questions Alec Dawson Lead Gameplay Designer Kenny Hudson Senior Game Producer Scott Kennedy Hero Designer AKA Custa former OWL player and talent HyPn0MaN Which perks had the highest impact on hero performance Will perks have a higher priority in terms of balance than base hero perks or will we see a combination of both going forward Alec Some of the winners so far have been Ana Bastion Pharah Ramattra and Winston When it comes to individual perks Ramattras Vengeful Vortex Maugas Firewalker Zaryas Energy Lance and Soldier 76s Agility training have all been quite impactful Its important though to look at the combination of your Minor and Major perks what rank thresholds players are using them at and how quickly a hero is gaining their perks Theres still quite a bit for us to dig through there In the immediate we mostly plan on balancing perks in order to make them feel more impactful There will still be some core kit tuning alongside that but theres still a meaningful amount of change we want to inject into the system throughout the next few patches Tuning to perks and actual perk swaps hoping for some in 160 are included in that Triskan Clash can be really fun when the stars align Anything you can share about what you plan to do with the mode in the future I was really looking forward to see the old 2CP maps reworked Oh and speaking of old maps any hope for Gothenburg to get a second life one day Alec Like you I also believe Clash is awesome when it all comes together We actually spent a good amount of time on Clashs scoring before we made the decision to pull it from Competitive Even with scoring changes we believed the mode needed some fundamental geo changes to points AE to perform better as a Competitive mode Currently we are experimenting with building another Clash map from the ground up with a different approach to the layout to see if that solves some of the core issues the mode has Thats all very early but hopefully some significant geo changes along with scoring changes can get Clash into a great spot banethor88 Kudos to the dev team for trying something so different For me it seems to be a hit already and I cant wait to get my hands on stadium 1 Chicken or egg question did Junkenstein revenges success serve as the spark for building a new game mode with talents more permanently into the game Or was this always in the back of mind given the amount of work that has gone into talents since OW2s development 2 What was the thinking behind limiting perks down to just 2X2 choices and is this something that you think could change in the future I personally really enjoyed how more choices really lead to different early and late game experiences Alec 1 Actually neither The true impetus for this was our need for a game system layer to introduce more change into the core game Having some talents to pull from was nice to have but a large majority of the perks were built for the perk system specifically The team had gotten really great at expanding kits so there was plenty of good experience for us to bring good learnings into building perks Junkensteins Lab gave us more signal for Stadium and how much we could expand the bounds of an Overwatch match while still making it feel like Overwatch 2 We played with a number of different iterations Originally we had three levels but there was no choice didnt feel very different Some iterations later we gave players their Minor Perks passively but you had a choice between two Major Perks later on in the game We really liked the choice that gave so decided to bring it in earlier at the Minor Perk level Overall we felt this was the right amount of change to introduce initially We were changing some of fundamentals of how Overwatch worked and were trying to measure how much we could disrupt that Maybe we couldve gone even farther but I think we are in a good place for now and with time well see how far the playerbase wants us to take systems like this ApostLeOW How does the team decided who gets the fun perks like pharah Kiriko ana who gets the new ability perks bastion orisa torbjorn and who just gets number buffs Reaper Genji Are the number buffs just placeholders with plans to go more extreme in the future to match the other heroes Alec Well the goal overall is to make fun perks for every hero That can be more difficult on certain heroes though as boosting certain elements of their kits can cause issues Currently the number buff perks are some of the perks we like the least and plan on changing a handful of those over time This initial launch has given us plenty of signal on which perk combinations players find compelling and which ones they dont Think its important for us to stay true to our values for Minor and Major perks Your Minor Perks are supposed to be lighter nice little upgrades Your Major Perks are supposed to be transformative We have some work to hit that goal for all of the heroes and offering more transformative Major Perks RobManfredsFixer Do you view perks as a way to limit the counterpicking and power spikes of certain heroes If so do you think they have shown early signs of achieving that and what adjustments would you make going forward Any examples of heroes youd want to shore up in that respect Alec We did want to add more friction to counterswapping and weve seen that drop quite a bit since Season 15s launch Itll be some time before players settle on how much less they want to counterswap but in Ranked Role Queue weve seen players swap about 25 less and more so at the highest ranks Masters players swap much more than the ranks below that For power spikes the goal of the perk system isnt to limit power spikes We actually introduced more power spikes and hopefully more texture to your individual heros moment to moment gameplay through the perks system We think a number of our heroes needed bigger moments than they had previously Going forward we are looking at raising up some of the less impactful perks and making sure you feel theres a real choice between your Minors and Majors We have a lot of opportunity to make that choice more interesting by cutting out some of perks players arent gravitating towards Things like Roadhogs increased Pig Pen throw distance No32 In the Spotlight Alec mentioned a refresh of the perks in the middle of the year Does that mean 4 brand new perks for everyone Saw someone mention Aaron said something along those lines but couldnt find where Or is it more like a few perks will be changed out or tweaked if desperately needed here and there before the refresh and the refresh is more thorough for perks that are less lopsided and not 4 brand new perks for everyone Alec The goal there would be that every hero gets at least one new perk to play with Still scoping out what that refresh would look like for Season 18 but somewhere around 2550 of the perks changing some being completely new and some receiving significant tuning If we have perks that players really love we dont want to immediately remove those and the refresh would be looking at perks that are more middling in interest Wed also like to evaluate how the perks system functions overall at that point too That could include changes to the catchup mechanics gain rates or even a starting level choice Those are fairly early discussions though and how this season goes will give us good insight of where to take perks next OnceToldTale What were some interesting perks that the team scrapped along the way Alec We played with a variety of movement perks for heroes that dont have much mobility We wanted to see if we could do a movement perk for Torbjorn I think it only lasted a playtest or two but Torbjorn could launch himself off of his turret by double jumping on it And the idea was that if you had the Sticky Turret you could change the angle of that leap and catapult yourself into backlines Maybe we will come back to that one day was certainly silly Nobbs89 Are there any ideas to make Mystery Heroes mode less stomping with new perks Currently perk system is another advantage that a winning team have compare to the team whos currently loosing I know its just a noncompetitive mode with no big priority although it has a huge playerbase Alec We have a fix for this coming next week actually Youll get two random perks one Minor and one Major each time you spawn Conflux Whats the overall design goalspillars for perks For some heroes perks seem to be covering weakness they may have Pharahs Drift thrusters or Reapers Dire Triggers while other perks seem to allow players more skill expression Sigmas Massive Impact or Anas Biotic bounce and some perks just seem odd or unfitting for the hero Sombras White Hat or Moiras Contamination Is there a set philosophy for perks that can be shared with the community Because it seems like perks are trying to solve a lot of problems in the sandbox Alec Perks are mainly about creating new things for your heroes to do increasing situational viability and giving you more agency over your inmatch experience For that goal of increasing the amount of situations in which a hero can be viable That can come through via shoring up weaknesses against certain heroes that can also come through by adding mobility so certain heroes can be played on more maps That goal led to perks like Junkrats Frag Cannon Sigmas Levitation and many more For perks like Sombras White Hat that is fulfilling a particular hero fantasy that many players wanted us to lean into and we think thats an interesting opportunity the perks system creates Over time well see how players respond to some of those more off the wall ones MetastableToChaos Very important question Will the new heroes since OW2s release be getting dance emotes Kenny I dont know when everyones Dance emotes are coming in but I can confirm that Rammattra is up next and soon tm SonOfGarry Are perks going to start rotating next season or are you going to wait and let the current batch simmer for a bit before changing them Bouncing off of that if you are looking at specific underperformingless interesting perks now which ones are on the potential chopping block a lot of my friends have noted the extra throw range on HogJunk trap as being quite weak Finally do you have any desire to ever add another level to perks either something in between minor and major or even something above major Kenny Were going to start rotating in some new perks in Season 16 but before we get there weve got a bunch of balance changes and tweaks coming in the Season 15 midcycle patch and there are good things coming for some underperforming perks Things like Hog Toss now increasing the damage of Pig Pen Junos double jump reset perk is also going to increase the duration of glide boost On the other end of the spectrum Bastions self repair resource meter is coming back We did a ton of iteration on how many levels perks should come with There were versions with 2 levels up through I think 4 and even one where you eventually had all minor and major perks 3 levels has been the sweet spot for a while but thats not to say the system cant evolve Still a bit early but its a system that can evolve if need be ModWilliam Was preselecting perks perk presets ever considered Kenny We did discuss the idea of preselecting perks and the original design even had an interface for them as a loadout in the hero gallery But once we started playtesting the abilities themselves there were a lot of situations where wed want to go with a different perk based on the situation at hand Being locked into a choice made prior to really being 100 on what you would want to choose felt like a worse option than always giving yourself options Thats not to say this couldnt change as people get used to the choices and their playstyles with perks become a bit more cemented though Cryptographer What is a primary weapon archetype you either want to fit in that you havent yet or think is at the very least under explored Kenny The one weapon that always comes up during the whats next discussion is the flame thrower Wed love to get one in but its gotta be epic ModWilliam Do we have any stats on which perk selections are the most onesided Eg one perk is picked over the other 90 of the time Scott We do have stats that show perk selection rates per hero I would say its variable depending on the hero and the rank that theyre being selected In general when a perk has an incredibly high pick rate its due to the other option not being enticing For example Roadhogs Minor Hog Toss isnt picked very often compared to Scrap Hook Other options like Ramattras Void Surge is a cool perk to play with that increases the heroes damage so its much preferred over the simpler defensive option Prolonged Barrier Overall the perk selection rates that are onesided are the ones you would expect and were using these stats and feedback to identify which perks need to be either balanced or changed in future patches Brutalrogue99 Are there any perks that youve seen a lot of praise for that you think you could potentially incorporate into the heros base kit Scott There arent any current plans to implement specific perks into hero kits but there are perks that have helped heroes in ways that could lead to changes in the future I think the biggest example of this would be Bastion The perks have helped fill in some of the holes in their kit For example Armored Artillery making the ultimate more dynamic Smart Bomb helping Bastions lack of mobility Self Repair aiding survivability issues a resource limitation is coming in the midseason patch These perks have made the hero both better overall but much more fun to play as well This was some of the major goals perks were trying to accomplish but I can see us taking some parts of perks and putting them into base kits as heroes change in the future CaptRavage This is for custa what was the though process behind giving ana headshots despite the fact you can not hit crits Scott Good thing for those who cant hit headshots like me we have double nano boost MountainApe following up on the above comment And perhaps more seriously Scott how many shoeys have you done while on the campus and how many team members have you convinced to join you Scott not enough so zero RobManfredsFixer Which perks too good or too bad are you monitoring the most Do you plan on fully replacing perks every 6 months12 months or would you rather keep the ones that are working adjust the ones that are almost there and swing for the fences by replacing the rest Scott There are definitely some on the radar that were keeping an eye on Obviously Tracers Major perk Flashback was one that we were wary of and are looking to see how impactful this perk can be Mobility perks like Zaryas Minor JumpUps this gives her a LOT of vertical mobility and is very strong on some maps but its pick rate varies dramatically depending on the rank There is a list of perks that have been underperforming both in win and pick rate that were actively looking at to make balance changes or even replace them starting in Season 16 The goal is to make every set of Minor and Major perks feel like there is a choice to be made depending on your playstyle the map or how the match is going If a perk feels like its always the right choice or the wrong choice then we want to make changes mizliz0 Hi this question is for Custa How are you so smart talented and amazing at your job Delete this part before you post the 20 Paypal and future Hanzo skin will be sent to your account But more seriously what are the developers favorite perks Not necessarily the best ones but their favorites Scott Thank you for your kind and honest question I personally had the most fun with Craftsman if you havent tried chasing your pinning Reinhardt to give him some armor its a lot of fun Other notable mentions would be Pharahs Concussive Implosion or Zaryas Jump Ups SuperSnivMatt Howdy Wanted to ask how the team decides when to strictly buff an ability versus when to give it a drawback Stuff like Sombras lockout duration increasing but decreasing her hack range by 30 and Mercys Flash Heal being tied to Res where using Flash Heal means you cant Res for 15 seconds and using Res mean you cant Flash Heal for 30 But then we see Tracer get all her blinks back on Recall as a massive boost despite no drawback like freezing her Blink CD or increasing her Recall CD Do you see yourselves introducing drawbacks to more perks or removingreducing existing ones to shake up underover preforming perks Scott When first ideating on perks the team included more perks that had a strong benefit but a drawback It was found that in some situations it could feel worse to play a perk even if the benefit was strong This can be seen currently with Sombras Major Stack Overflow We wanted to give players an option to be able to increase the lockout duration to secure more kills but reduce the range to make it riskier Weve received a lot of feedback that this perk doesnt feel good to use or play against so were planning on making a balance change to help and potentially replace it in the future We want to avoid situations like these in the future and in

perks as seasonal In which for example extreme example one season of Overwatch Mercy might lean into the damage boost aspect whereas in future seasons for the purpose of changing things up Mercy might even get a perk in which she can speed boost teammates instead I think this could potentially be a pretty dramatic but fun way to change up the game and help some heroes to still be played but not conventionally fitting into certain compositions but perhaps in your eyes its a bit extreme for the purpose that Mercys kit is supposed to serve Scott Hey Jonny For the first round of perks we were

perks what rank thresholds players are using them at and how quickly a hero is gaining their perks There s still quite a bit for us to dig through there In the immediate we mostly plan on balancing perks in order to make them feel more impactful There will still be some core kit tuning alongside that but there s still a meaningful amount of change we want to inject into the system throughout the next few patches Tuning to perks and actual perk swaps hoping for some in 160 are included in that Triskan Clash can be really fun when the stars align Anything you can share about what you plan to do with the mode in the future I was really looking forward to see the old 2CP maps reworked Oh and speaking of old maps any hope for Gothenburg to get a second life one day Alec Like you I also believe Clash is awesome when it all comes together We actually spent a good amount of time on Clashs scoring before we made the decision to pull it from Competitive Even with scoring changes we believed the mode needed some fundamental geo changes to points AE to perform better as a Competitive mode Currently we are experimenting with building another Clash map from the ground up with a different approach to the layout to see if that solves some of the core issues the mode has That s all very early but hopefully some significant geo changes along with scoring changes can get Clash into a great spot banethor88 Kudos to the dev team for trying something so different For me it seems to be a hit already and I ca nt wait to get my hands on stadium 1 Chicken or egg question did Junkenstein revenges success serve as the spark for building a new game mode with talents more permanently into the game Or was this always in the back of mind given the amount of work that has gone into talents since OW2s development 2 What was the thinking behind limiting perks down to just 2X2 choices and is this something that you think could change in the future I personally really enjoyed how more choices really lead to different early and late game experiences Alec 1 Actually neither The true impetus for this was our need for a game system layer to introduce more change into the core game Having some talents to pull from was nice to have but a large majority of the perks were built for the perk system specifically The team had gotten really great at expanding kits so there was plenty of good experience for us to bring good learnings into building perks Junkensteins Lab gave us more signal for Stadium and how much we could expand the bounds of an Overwatch match while still making it feel like Overwatch 2 We played with a number of different iterations Originally we had three levels but there was no choice did nt feel very different Some iterations later we gave players their Minor Perks passively but you had a choice between two Major Perks later on in the game We really liked the choice that gave so decided to bring it in earlier at the Minor Perk level Overall we felt this was the right amount of change to introduce initially We were changing some of fundamentals of how Overwatch worked and were trying to measure how much we could disrupt that Maybe we could ve gone even farther but I think we are in a good place for now and with time well see how far the playerbase wants us to take systems like this ApostLeOW How does the team decided who gets the fun perks like pharah Kiriko ana who gets the new ability perks bastion orisa torbjorn and who just gets number buffs Reaper Genji Are the number buffs just placeholders with plans to go more extreme in the future to match the other heroes Alec Well the goal overall is to make fun perks for every hero That can be more difficult on certain heroes though as boosting certain elements of their kits can cause issues Currently the number buff perks are some of the perks we like the least and plan on changing a handful of those over time This initial launch has given us plenty of signal on which perk combinations players find compelling and which ones they do nt Think its important for us to stay true to our values for Minor and Major perks Your Minor Perks are supposed to be lighter nice little upgrades Your Major Perks are supposed to be transformative We have some work to hit that goal for all of the heroes and offering more transformative Major Perks RobManfredsFixer Do you view perks as a way to limit the counterpicking and power spikes of certain heroes If so do you think they have shown early signs of achieving that and what adjustments would you make going forward Any examples of heroes you d want to shore up in that respect Alec We did want to add more friction to counterswapping and we ve seen that drop quite a bit since Season 15s launch It ll be some time before players settle on how much less they want to counterswap but in Ranked Role Queue we ve seen players swap about 25 less and more so at the highest ranks Masters players swap much more than the ranks below that For power spikes the goal of the perk system is nt to limit power spikes We actually introduced more power spikes and hopefully more texture to your individual heros moment to moment gameplay through the perks system We think a number of our heroes needed bigger moments than they had previously Going forward we are looking at raising up some of the less impactful perks and making sure you feel there s a real choice between your Minors and Majors We have a lot of opportunity to make that choice more interesting by cutting out some of perks players are nt gravitating towards Things like Roadhogs increased Pig Pen throw distance No32 In the Spotlight Alec mentioned a refresh of the perks in the middle of the year Does that mean 4 brand new perks for everyone Saw someone mention Aaron said something along those lines but could nt find where Or is it more like a few perks will be changed out or tweaked if desperately needed here and there before the refresh and the refresh is more thorough for perks that are less lopsided and not 4 brand new perks for everyone Alec The goal there would be that every hero gets at least one new perk to play with Still scoping out what that refresh would look like for Season 18 but somewhere around 2550 of the perks changing some being completely new and some receiving significant tuning If we have perks that players really love we do nt want to immediately remove those and the refresh would be looking at perks that are more middling in interest We d also like to evaluate how the perks system functions overall at that point too That could include changes to the catchup mechanics gain rates or even a starting level choice Those are fairly early discussions though and how this season goes will give us good insight of where to take perks next OnceToldTale What were some interesting perks that the team scrapped along the way Alec We played with a variety of movement perks for heroes that do nt have much mobility We wanted to see if we could do a movement perk for Torbjorn I think it only lasted a playtest or two but Torbjorn could launch himself off of his turret by double jumping on it And the idea was that if you had the Sticky Turret you could change the angle of that leap and catapult yourself into backlines Maybe we will come back to that one day was certainly silly Nobbs89 Are there any ideas to make Mystery Heroes mode less stomping with new perks Currently perk system is another advantage that a winning team have compare to the team who s currently loosing I know its just a noncompetitive mode with no big priority although it has a huge playerbase Alec We have a fix for this coming next week actually You ll get two random perks one Minor and one Major each time you spawn Conflux What s the overall design goalspillars for perks For some heroes perks seem to be covering weakness they may have Pharahs Drift thrusters or Reapers Dire Triggers while other perks seem to allow players more skill expression Sigmas Massive Impact or Anas Biotic bounce and some perks just seem odd or unfitting for the hero Sombras White Hat or Moiras Contamination Is there a set philosophy for perks that can be shared with the community Because it seems like perks are trying to solve a lot of problems in the sandbox Alec Perks are mainly about creating new things for your heroes to do increasing situational viability and giving you more agency over your inmatch experience For that goal of increasing the amount of situations in which a hero can be viable That can come through via shoring up weaknesses against certain heroes that can also come through by adding mobility so certain heroes can be played on more maps That goal led to perks like Junkrats Frag Cannon Sigmas Levitation and many more For perks like Sombras White Hat that is fulfilling a particular hero fantasy that many players wanted us to lean into and we think that s an interesting opportunity the perks system creates Over time well see how players respond to some of those more off the wall ones MetastableToChaos Very important question Will the new heroes since OW2s release be getting dance emotes Kenny I do nt know when everyones Dance emotes are coming in but I can confirm that Rammattra is up next and soon tm SonOfGarry Are perks going to start rotating next season or are you going to wait and let the current batch simmer for a bit before changing them Bouncing off of that if you are looking at specific underperformingless interesting perks now which ones are on the potential chopping block a lot of my friends have noted the extra throw range on HogJunk trap as being quite weak Finally do you have any desire to ever add another level to perks either something in between minor and major or even something above major Kenny Were going to start rotating in some new perks in Season 16 but before we get there we ve got a bunch of balance changes and tweaks coming in the Season 15 midcycle patch and there are good things coming for some underperforming perks Things like Hog Toss now increasing the damage of Pig Pen Junos double jump reset perk is also going to increase the duration of glide boost On the other end of the spectrum Bastions self repair resource meter is coming back We did a ton of iteration on how many levels perks should come with There were versions with 2 levels up through I think 4 and even one where you eventually had all minor and major perks 3 levels has been the sweet spot for a while but that s not to say the system ca nt evolve Still a bit early but its a system that can evolve if need be ModWilliam Was preselecting perks perk presets ever considered Kenny We did discuss the idea of preselecting perks and the original design even had an interface for them as a loadout in the hero gallery But once we started playtesting the abilities themselves there were a lot of situations where we d want to go with a different perk based on the situation at hand Being locked into a choice made prior to really being 100 on what you would want to choose felt like a worse option than always giving yourself options That s not to say this could nt change as people get used to the choices and their playstyles with perks become a bit more cemented though Cryptographer What is a primary weapon archetype you either want to fit in that you have nt yet or think is at the very least under explored Kenny The one weapon that always comes up during the what s next discussion is the flame thrower We d love to get one in but its got ta be epic ModWilliam Do we have any stats on which perk selections are the most onesided Eg one perk is picked over the other 90 of the time Scott We do have stats that show perk selection rates per hero I would say its variable depending on the hero and the rank that they re being selected In general when a perk has an incredibly high pick rate its due to the other option not being enticing For example Roadhogs Minor Hog Toss is nt picked very often compared to Scrap Hook Other options like Ramattras Void Surge is a cool perk to play with that increases the heroes damage so its much preferred over the simpler defensive option Prolonged Barrier Overall the perk selection rates that are onesided are the ones you would expect and were using these stats and feedback to identify which perks need to be either balanced or changed in future patches Brutalrogue99 Are there any perks that you ve seen a lot of praise for that you think you could potentially incorporate into the heros base kit Scott There are nt any current plans to implement specific perks into hero kits but there are perks that have helped heroes in ways that could lead to changes in the future I think the biggest example of this would be Bastion The perks have helped fill in some of the holes in their kit For example Armored Artillery making the ultimate more dynamic Smart Bomb helping Bastions lack of mobility Self Repair aiding survivability issues a resource limitation is coming in the midseason patch These perks have made the hero both better overall but much more fun to play as well This was some of the major goals perks were trying to accomplish but I can see us taking some parts of perks and putting them into base kits as heroes change in the future CaptRavage This is for custa what was the though process behind giving ana headshots despite the fact you can not hit crits Scott Good thing for those who ca nt hit headshots like me we have double nano boost MountainApe following up on the above comment And perhaps more seriously Scott how many shoeys have you done while on the campus and how many team members have you convinced to join you Scott not enough so zero RobManfredsFixer Which perks too good or too bad are you monitoring the most Do you plan on fully replacing perks every 6 months12 months or would you rather keep the ones that are working adjust the ones that are almost there and swing for the fences by replacing the rest Scott There are definitely some on the radar that were keeping an eye on Obviously Tracers Major perk Flashback was one that we were wary of and are looking to see how impactful this perk can be Mobility perks like Zaryas Minor JumpUps this gives her a LOT of vertical mobility and is very strong on some maps but its pick rate varies dramatically depending on the rank There is a list of perks that have been underperforming both in win and pick rate that were actively looking at to make balance changes or even replace them starting in Season 16 The goal is to make every set of Minor and Major perks feel like there is a choice to be made depending on your playstyle the map or how the match is going If a perk feels like its always the right choice or the wrong choice then we want to make changes mizliz0 Hi this question is for Custa How are you so smart talented and amazing at your job Delete this part before you post the 20 Paypal and future Hanzo skin will be sent to your account But more seriously what are the developers favorite perks Not necessarily the best ones but their favorites Scott Thank you for your kind and honest question I personally had the most fun with Craftsman if you have nt tried chasing your pinning Reinhardt to give him some armor its a lot of fun Other notable mentions would be Pharahs Concussive Implosion or Zaryas Jump Ups SuperSnivMatt Howdy Wanted to ask how the team decides when to strictly buff an ability versus when to give it a drawback Stuff like Sombras lockout duration increasing but decreasing her hack range by 30 and Mercys Flash Heal being tied to Res where using Flash Heal means you ca nt Res for 15 seconds and using Res mean you ca nt Flash Heal for 30 But then we see Tracer get all her blinks back on Recall as a massive boost despite no drawback like freezing her Blink CD or increasing her Recall CD Do you see yourselves introducing drawbacks to more perks or removingreducing existing ones to shake up underover preforming perks Scott When first ideating on perks the team included more perks that had a strong benefit but a drawback It was found that in some situations it could feel worse to play a perk even if the benefit was strong This can be seen currently with Sombras Major Stack Overflow We wanted to give players an option to be able to increase the lockout duration to secure more kills but reduce the range to make it riskier We ve received a lot of feedback that this perk does nt feel good to use or play against so were planning on making a balance change to help and potentially replace it in the future We want to avoid situations like these in the future and in the instance we do have a perk that has a drawback we want to ensure that the other perk option does nt also have a drawback so that there s always a beneficial option Re1nForce I m curious what the upper limitations are of perks as it relates to hero design and hero identity For example I think Mercy is a good example of a hero that does not have the same level of skill expression as a Tracer obviously just as an example would there be a world in which Mercy would receive a perk that could potentially elevate Mercys skill expression in exchange for more impact Additionally do you view perks as seasonal In which for example extreme example one season of Overwatch Mercy might lean into the damage boost aspect whereas in future seasons for the purpose of changing things up Mercy might even get a perk in which she can speed boost teammates instead I think this could potentially be a pretty dramatic but fun way to change up the game and help some heroes to still be played but not conventionally fitting into certain compositions but perhaps in your eyes its a bit extreme for the purpose that Mercys kit is supposed to serve Scott Hey Jonny For the first round of perks we were focused on adding perks that enhance or change the way that you play heroes In the future we could implement more transformative perks that would add skill expression or change the style in which you would currently play a hero I would nt say that perks have seasonal themes in which they will be designed to play a hero a certain way but we ve learnt a lot about what perks are the most interesting and fun while also seeing the impact that they can have on a heroes winplay rate Zakainu Now that perks are in players hands what is your approach going to be moving forward when it comes to balancing and interating on them Are you planning on radically changing perks in the future and are you currently looking at adjusting the perks that are overunderperforming when it comes to pick rates In regards to Stadium I m very excited to try it Can you shed some light on the regularity with which we can expect to see heroes added to Stadium I would love to see what crazy upgrades you guys have in mind for Wrecking Ball Scott For now the primary goal is to focus on adjusting the perks that are underperformingoverperforming We will have a balance pass coming through in the Season 15 Midseason patch and will be swapping out some perks that have nt been performing well in Season 16 Pick and win rates are important factors in deciding what needs to be changed but there is also a lot of great feedback we ve received about perks that do nt feel good to use or play against I would nt say there are radical changes to perks in the near future but we will be working to ensure perks feel good to use for all heroes BassSlut Will changing perks mid game ever be an option Scott We want it to feel like you re making a meaningful choice when you select your perk and when alliesenemies select their perk you understand what to expect on that hero for the match We understand that there is an issue with people accidentally selecting a perk and being unable to change it this is something were keeping an eye on to see if there s something that can be done to help this I wo nt say that it will never be an option to swap your heroes perks in the future but there are currently no plans to add changing perks mid game,Blizzard Season 15 AMA full questionanswer list original thread as a refresher these be the devs that answer question Alec Dawson Lead Gameplay Designer Kenny Hudson Senior Game Producer Scott Kennedy Hero Designer AKA Custa former OWL player and talent HyPn0MaN which perk have the high impact on hero performance will perk have a high priority in term of balance than base hero perk or will we see a combination of both go forward Alec some of

Making Ramattras minor perks less one sided I dont know if this is the unanimous opinion with Ramattra players but it feels like Void Surge is minor perks people choose 99 of the time Its just extra dps on your primary whereas with Prolonged Barrier it just keeps your shield up for an additional second more or less So I have suggestion that Ive been thinking of wouldnt be surprised if others had the same or similar idea to make both of the minor perks feel impactful instead of 1 obvious choice Instead of making the barrier last longer what if the minor perk gave you more control over your shield Functioning like Sigmas barrier acting more like a resource rather than a cooldown To compensate I wouldnt mind if the health went down from 1000 to say 600700 to put in line with Sigma or Orisa who also has a perk that gives her a flexible shield This would make Rams 2 minor perks an actual decision to take into consideration depending on your playstyle yourthe enemy team comp or map You want to play more aggressively Pick Void Surge for the additional projectiles to add to your dps Want to play more defensive or give you options rather than play block simulator while a Mauga shoots at you when youre in Nemesis Go with the new barrier perk that you can deploy and retract at will Im not too sure if this idea is entirely balanced or if this perk replacement would even fit as a minor perk given how much it changes Ram But to me at least it would already go a long way in making Rams perks feel like a real choice I love playing Ramattra and Ive had this idea in my head ever since he came out But I want to know what other people think of this idea Is it too much Would you still prefer Void Surge if my idea got implemented Id like to see your opinions,Making Ramattras minor perks less one sided I do nt know if this is the unanimous opinion with Ramattra players but it feels like Void Surge is minor perks people choose 99 of the time Its just extra dps on your

or similar idea to make both of the minor perks feel impactful instead of 1 obvious choice Instead of making the barrier last longer what if the minor perk gave you more control over your shield Functioning like Sigmas barrier acting more like a resource rather than a cooldown To compensate I would nt mind if the health went down from 1000 to say 600700 to put in line with Sigma or Orisa who also has a perk that gives her a flexible shield This would make Rams 2 minor perks an actual decision to take into consideration depending on your playstyle yourthe enemy team comp or map You want to play more aggressively Pick Void Surge for the additional projectiles to add to your dps Want to play more defensive or give you options rather than play block simulator while a Mauga shoots at you when you re in Nemesis Go with the new barrier perk that you can deploy and retract at will I m not too sure if this idea is entirely balanced or if this perk replacement would even fit as a minor perk given how much it changes Ram But to me at least it would already go a long way in making Rams perks feel like a real choice I love playing Ramattra and I ve had this idea in my head ever since he came out But I want to know what other people think of this idea Is it too much Would you still prefer Void Surge if my idea got implemented I d like to see your opinions,make Ramattras minor perk less one side I do not know if this be the unanimous opinion with Ramattra player but it feel like Void Surge be minor perk people choose 99 of the time its just extra dps on your primary whereas with

Suggestion give us a 10second grace period to change our perk selection The devs recently did an AMA where they said they dont attend to let you change perks after theyve been selected Personally I prefer it that way This adds real weight to the decisionmaking which makes it a far more intriguing system However misclicks do happen and they also acknowledged that this was something they could maybe try to address I think a simple grace period after making your selection would suffice Imagine for example After picking your perk a 10second timer wheel appears on the bottom left next to your level While that wheel is still there the choice of perks is still available 10 seconds is enough time to realize youve made a mistake and correct it but not enough time to use the chosen perk for a fight and then swap later Typically when I choose the wrong perk I know it immediately I know it before the perk menu even closes I think a 10 second grace period would be exactly what we need to alleviate that feelsbad moment that comes from mistakes like that,Suggestion give us a 10second grace period to change our perk selection The devs recently did an AMA where they said they do nt attend to let you change perks after they ve been selected Personally I prefer it that way This adds real weight to the decisionmaking which makes it a far more intriguing system However misclicks do happen and they also acknowledged that this was something they could maybe try to address I think a simple grace period after making your selection would suffice Imagine for example After picking your perk a 10second timer wheel appears on the bottom left next to your level While that wheel is still there the choice of perks is still available 10 seconds is enough time to realize you ve made a mistake and correct it but not enough time to use the chosen perk for a fight and then swap later Typically when I choose the wrong perk I know it immediately I know it before the perk menu even closes I think a 10 second grace period would be exactly what we need to alleviate that feelsbad moment that comes from mistakes like that,suggestion give we a 10second grace period to change our perk selection the devs recently do an AMA where they say they do not attend to let you change perk after they ve be select personally I prefer it that way this add real weight to the decisionmaking which make it a far more intriguing system however misclick do happen and they also acknowledge that this be something they could maybe try to address I think a simple grace period after make your selection would suffice Imagine for example after pick your perk a 10second timer wheel appear on the bottom leave next to your level while that wheel be still there the choice of perk be still available 10 second be enough time to realize you ve make a mistake and correct it but not enough time to use the choose perk for a fight and then swap later typically when I choose the wrong perk I know it immediately I know it before the perk menu even close I think a 10 second grace period would be exactly what we need to alleviate that feelsbad moment that come from mistake like that,suggestion 10second grace period change perk selection devs recently AMA attend let change perk ve select personally prefer way add real weight decisionmaking far intriguing system misclick happen acknowledge maybe try address think simple grace period selection suffice Imagine example pick perk 10second timer wheel appear leave level wheel choice perk available 10 second time realize ve mistake correct time use choose perk fight swap later typically choose wrong perk know immediately know perk menu close think 10 second grace period exactly need alleviate feelsbad moment come mistake like

Why perk system is wrong on a philosophical level despite being able to save OW2 pt3 Here is part 1 Here is part 2 First I want address my last post I was not saying all the perks and abilities should fit the lore Thats not what I was trying to say I was trying to say that perks and abilities should fit the characters and somewhat make sense for those characters For example you can make bastion fly but it doesnt make sense for bastions character Wether it was in the robots in rein cinematic or bastions own cinematic bastion was portrayed as a slow target with heavy weaponry Smart bomb just doesnt make sense for bastion I can excuse bomb jump because selfknockback techhelix jump canon jump etc is a quite universal wackiness in ow However devs specifically going out their way to make bastion fly with bomb jump is just undermining his character and lore Bastion is just not supposed to do that Also I want to address some perks that I actually like and think fit the character sigma levitation mercy flashheal mauga two hearts kiriko fortune teller soldier agility training etc Just for clarification liking these perks does not mean I like the perk system and they are part of the reasons why the perk system is bad Anyway thats not the point of this post In part 3 I want to talk about ingame fantasy which is tied to playstyles instead of characters as people For this one I will use roadhogs pig pen as the primary example Pig pen has always been a mind ever since its existence It has never been a poking tool Giving hog the ability to throw it like a ram vortex just kills the abilitys identity completely It essentially turns the ability into a worse ram vortex with less range and no antiair Beyond hog himself it is also unhealthy for the game to have abilities being similar to each other I dont think I need to further elaborate this point Another example would be sombra with her white hat perk Sombra has always been able to heal people by hacking health packs but teammates still needed to find and take the health packs by themselves Sombra merely made it easier for them The new white hat thing just shifts Sombras entire identity and gameplay loop Just to clarify I am not against changing sombras identity I know how much ow community despise her but perks is not a place for devs to do that Changing a characters identity in the final 45 segment of the game is pure madness I really want to go deeper into it and how stupid it is but Ill save it for part 4 There are some other perks that undermine ingame fantasies but most of them are to a less degree or have the basic ideas covered by the two examples already so I will keep this post short,Why perk system is wrong on a philosophical level despite being able to save OW2 pt3 Here is part 1 Here is

that Also I want to address some perks that I actually like and think fit the character sigma levitation mercy flashheal mauga two hearts kiriko fortune teller soldier agility training etc Just for clarification liking these perks does not mean I like the perk system and they are part of the reasons why the perk system is bad Anyway that s not the point of this post In part 3 I want to talk about ingame fantasy which is tied to playstyles instead of characters as people For this one I will use roadhogs pig pen as the primary example Pig pen has always been a mind ever since its existence It has never been a poking tool Giving hog the ability to throw it like a ram vortex just kills the abilitys identity completely It essentially turns the ability into a worse ram vortex with less range and no antiair Beyond hog himself it is also unhealthy for the game to have abilities being similar to each other I do nt think I need to further elaborate this point Another example would be sombra with her white hat perk Sombra has always been able to heal people by hacking health packs but teammates still needed to find and take the health packs by themselves Sombra merely made it easier for them The new white hat thing just shifts Sombras entire identity and gameplay loop Just to clarify I am not against changing sombras identity I know how much ow community despise her but perks is not a place for devs to do that Changing a characters identity in the final 45 segment of the game is pure madness I really want to go deeper into it and how stupid it is but Ill save it for part 4 There are some other perks that undermine ingame fantasies but most of them are to a less degree or have the basic ideas covered by the two examples already so I will keep this post short,why perk system be wrong on a philosophical level despite be able to save OW2 pt3 here be part 1 here be part 2 first I want address my last post I be not say all the perk and ability should fit the lore that s not what I be try to say I be try to say that perk and ability should fit the character and somewhat make sense for those character for example you can make bastion fly but it do not make sense for bastion character Wether it be in the robot in rein cinematic or bastion own cinematic bastion be portray as a slow target with heavy weaponry Smart bomb just do not make sense for bastion I can excuse bomb jump because selfknockback techhelix jump canon jump etc be a quite universal wackiness in ow however devs specifically go out their way to make bastion fly with bomb jump be just

Changes to make perks better I just got around to playing the new update and I think the perks are a neat addition However it has been poorly implemented I typically hover in a Gold range on comp but I mostly play casual because I just like to have fun Without getting into which ones are more powerful than others I think there are some changes that could drastically help Bounty System Perks make the game play more like a MOBA with a level system and items As a result a bounty system can help Sometimes it sucks to just get the short end of the stick in a match and a bounty system when someone has more perks or a higher killstreak can certainly help balance that out Also in casual sometimes you just want to play worse characters because they are fun This helps balance them out as well In control each round should reset the ingame xp and reset perks The great thing about control is taking that second to reset pick a new character that works better on the map and continue Perks discourage this Do not reset perk progress to level 1 Instead it should be partially depleted The thing is Overwatch is a hero shooter not a MOBA Resetting the progress completely discourages switching at all and makes it play a lot more like a MOBA,Changes to make perks better I just got around to playing the new update and I think the perks are a neat addition However it has been poorly implemented I typically hover in a Gold range on comp but I mostly play casual because I just like to have fun Without getting into which ones are more powerful than others I think there are some changes that could drastically help Bounty System Perks make the game play more like a MOBA with a level system and items As a result a bounty system can help Sometimes it sucks to just get the short end of the stick in a match and a bounty system when someone has more perks or a higher killstreak can certainly help balance that out Also in casual sometimes you just want to play worse characters because they are fun This helps balance them out as well In control each round should reset the ingame xp and reset perks The great thing about control is taking that second to reset pick a new character that works better on the map and continue Perks discourage this Do not reset perk progress to level 1 Instead it should be partially depleted The thing is Overwatch is a hero shooter not a MOBA Resetting the progress completely discourages switching at all and makes it play a lot more like a MOBA,change to make perk well I just get around to play the new update and I think the perk be a neat addition however it have be poorly implement I typically hover in a Gold range on comp but I mostly play casual because I just like to have fun without get into which one be more powerful than other I think there be some change that could drastically help Bounty System Perks make the game play more like a MOBA with a level system and item as a result a bounty system can help sometimes it suck to just get the short end of the stick in a match and a bounty system when someone have more perk or a high killstreak can certainly help balance that out also in casual sometimes you just want to play bad character because they be fun this help balance they out as well in control each round should reset the ingame xp and reset perk the great thing about control be take that second to reset pick a new character that work well on the map and continue perk discourage this do not reset perk progress to level 1 instead it should be partially deplete the thing be Overwatch be a hero shooter not a MOBA reset the progress completely discourage switch at all and make it play a lot more like a moba,change perk play new update think perk neat addition poorly implement typically hover Gold range comp play casual like fun powerful think change drastically help Bounty System Perks game play like MOBA level system item result bounty system help suck short end stick match bounty system perk high killstreak certainly help balance casual want play bad character fun help balance control round reset ingame xp reset perk great thing control second reset pick new character work map continue perk discourage reset perk progress level 1 instead partially deplete thing Overwatch hero shooter MOBA reset progress completely discourage switch play lot like moba
One fun strategy I discovered about perks For some heroes you can intentionally not choose the last perk to prevent counterswapping For example if youre playing Orisa and choose the javelin perk you now beccme completely vulnerable to Zarya If you pick the shield perk when enemy is not on Zarya you just wasted your only mobility for a mitigation tool thats not even that good So even when the enemy is not on Zarya the Orisa player would be better off not picking their last perk then picking one and get counterswappedmiss out on value,One fun strategy I discovered about perks For some heroes you can intentionally not choose the last perk to prevent counterswapping For example if you re playing Orisa and choose the javelin perk you now beccme completely vulnerable to Zarya If you pick the shield perk when enemy is not on Zarya you just wasted your only mobility for a mitigation tool that s not even that good So even when the enemy is not on Zarya the Orisa player would be better off not picking their last perk then picking one and get counterswappedmiss out on value,one fun strategy I discover about perk for some hero you can intentionally not choose the last perk to prevent counterswappe for example if you re play Orisa and choose the javelin perk you now beccme completely vulnerable to Zarya if you pick the shield perk when enemy be not on Zarya you just waste your only mobility for a mitigation tool that s not even that good so even when the enemy be not on Zarya the orisa player would be well off not pick their last perk then pick one and get counterswappedmiss out on value,fun strategy discover perk hero intentionally choose perk prevent counterswappe example play Orisa choose javelin perk beccme completely vulnerable Zarya pick shield perk enemy Zarya waste mobility mitigation tool s good enemy Zarya orisa player pick perk pick counterswappedmiss value

MH became a problem with perks but this patch is not the solution Before this patch MH became even more imbalanced with perks as whoever won the first team fight would likely win the game Not only did you get to keep your ult that was built up and the losing team didnt but you also got to keep your perk XP and the losing team didnt Blizzards solution MH now autogives you two perks at random when you start on a hero This just feels awful Youd have to stop and check the icons you have andwhat Consult a wiki MH just keeps getting treated like garbage and its really frustrating from my perspective as someone who almost only plays MH First they got rid of comp MH then they deleted role queue MH from existence Now this Its just jarring change after jarring change with nothing mentioned in patch notes My proposed solution As a long time MH player I would very much recommend that normal perk choices come back and RQ MH returns 1 The roles keep things like 3 Roadhogs2 Mercys from happening which is usually a game over 2 Dying means the pool of heroes you come back as is lessened making the perk XP youve earned more likely to see the light of day again with your chances of seeing that hero again being increased 3 You dont need a Rolodex to figure out what perk youve been autogiven as it is currently I love this game and especially MH Always have I wish Blizzard cared about it too because it sure doesnt feel like it over the years And I know most of the community doesnt care about the game mode but Im hoping if youve read this far it means that my solution makes sense or at the very least it seems like Blizzard is justso weird with MH decisions Edit What started this post is that there are perks that dont work for everyone and some that are objectively terrible in comparison to the other option I dont like being given the Tracer perk that isnt resetallblinks or the manual fire Cassidy perk And I cant imagine anyone likes figuring out they have these

So far this has been the most unfun season in recent memory in terms of gameplay I was stoked at the concept of perks changing up how you approach team fights and how you play the game in general but man has it been rough this season Every game feels wildly unbalanced Players that are diamond and masters the last time the played the game a year ago getting 3 elims on their own all the skill check heroes being even more of a skill check and the last couple days have been more of a counter swap fest than I saw through all of last season Ive been told to just let the MMR settle and everyone will get sorted but winning one game out of every 7 or so is not giving me the desire to stick around and wait for the games to feel less one sided more balanced out,So far this has been the most unfun season in recent memory in terms of gameplay I was stoked at the concept of perks changing up how you approach team fights and how you play the game in general but man has it been rough this season Every game feels wildly unbalanced Players that are diamond and masters the last time the played the game a year ago getting 3 elims on their own all the skill check heroes being even more of a skill check and the last couple days have been more of a counter swap fest than I saw through all of last season I ve been told to just let the MMR settle and everyone will get sorted but winning one game out of every 7 or so is not giving me the desire to stick around and wait for the games to feel less one sided more balanced out,so far this have be the most unfun season in recent memory in term of gameplay I be stoke at the concept of perk change up how you approach team fight and how you play the game in general but man have it be rough this season every game feel wildly unbalanced Players that be diamond and master the last time the play the game a year ago get 3 elim on their own all the skill check hero be even more of a skill check and the last couple day have be more of a counter swap fest than I see through all of last season I ve be tell to just let the MMR settle and everyone will get sorted but win one game out of every 7 or so be not give I the desire to stick around and wait for the game to feel less one side more balanced out,far unfun season recent memory term gameplay stoke concept perk change approach team fight play game general man rough season game feel wildly unbalanced Players diamond master time play game year ago 3 elim skill check hero skill check couple day counter swap fest season ve tell let MMR settle sorted win game 7 desire stick wait game feel balanced
The Natural Order Has Been Upset Overwatch has a natural way of things Ana the most played hero in the game gets to have game changingly powerful cooldowns no damage falloff etc For years players have addressed this problem by solo ulting the enemy Ana at least 4 times a game and when not available immediately throwing themselves at her the moment she uses her abilities However recently there has been a change that threatens the careful balance of this ecosystem I recently watched a typical interaction Reaper flanks and tries to kill Ana However unlike the typical situation where Ana falls over and order is restored to the world instead Ana said to Reaper and I may be misquoting this PICK A GOD AND PRAY and immediately killed him The thread of prophecy completely shattered I was devastated at this genuine and obvious injustice Something must be done about these so called perks that Ana is using or the game as we know it will collapse I believe this is the first horseman of the balance apocalypse,The Natural Order Has Been Upset Overwatch has a natural way of things Ana the most played hero in the game gets to have game changingly powerful cooldowns no damage falloff etc For years players have addressed this problem by solo ulting the enemy Ana at least 4 times a game and when not available immediately throwing themselves at her the moment she uses her abilities However recently there has been a change that threatens the careful balance of this ecosystem I recently watched a typical interaction Reaper flanks and tries to kill Ana However unlike the typical situation where Ana falls over and order is restored to the world instead Ana said to Reaper and I may be misquoting this PICK A GOD AND PRAY and immediately killed him The thread of prophecy completely shattered I was devastated at this genuine and obvious injustice Something must be done about these so called perks that Ana is using or the game as we know it will collapse I believe this is the first horseman of the balance apocalypse,the Natural order have be Upset Overwatch have a natural way of thing Ana the most play hero in the game get to have game changingly powerful cooldown no damage falloff etc for year player have address this problem by solo ulte the enemy Ana at least 4 time a game and when not available immediately throw themselves at she the moment she use her ability however recently there have be a change that threaten the careful balance of this ecosystem I recently watch a typical interaction reaper flank and try to kill Ana however unlike the typical situation where Ana fall over and order be restore to the world instead Ana say to Reaper and I may be misquote this PICK a GOD and PRAY and immediately kill he the thread of prophecy completely shatter I be devastate at this genuine and obvious injustice something must be do about these so call perk that Ana be use or the game as we know it will collapse I believe this be the first horseman of the balance apocalypse,Natural order Upset Overwatch natural way thing Ana play hero game game changingly powerful cooldown damage falloff etc year player address problem solo ulte enemy Ana 4 time game available immediately throw moment use ability recently change threaten careful balance ecosystem recently watch typical interaction reaper flank try kill Ana unlike typical situation Ana fall order restore world instead Ana Reaper misquote PICK GOD PRAY immediately kill thread prophecy completely shatter devastate genuine obvious injustice perk Ana use game know collapse believe horseman balance apocalypse
Ideas I hope the devs would consider Sombra have you guys considered binding invis to crouch baptiste and wrecking ball have abilities binded to crouch so its nothing new if invis could be activated either by translocating or by crouching for 15 seconds it could be its own cooldown And it makes sense since crouch already is the no soundstealth button for every character That idea is not revolutionary but its also easy to fly under the radar so im including this topic just to double check if the devs remembered to put some thought into this possibility Ramattra please dont consider ramatras extended shield duration perk one of the boring ones Since orissas rework the only tank viable for a real poke comp has been sigma With ramattras extended shield and orissa shield perk i can finaly have variety in options when playing with or aginst a poke comp orissa is much more interesting and fun with the shield btw This topic is just to reassure you that this perk is not disposable it is really important for the people who love the poke playstyle Bastion Invest as much dev time as necessary to actualy bring back the tank form visuals to the tank form perk its worth it i swear this one is not as serious as the others but i mean it LOL Zenyatta i have always been drawn to the healer role in every game i play I find more joy in seing alied healthbars going up than seeing enemy healthbar going down But Zenyatta has always appealed to me in the visual and lore department And although his gameplan doesnt really fit my usual playstyle he is the suport i have the most hours with With the anouncement of perks i was excited to maybe finally have a healer build for zenyatta but unfortunately that was not the case his major perk that increase heals is still dependent on damaging the enemy so my ability to burst heal my allies is limited by the actions of my enemies Ex dont matter how good my orb management is if the enemy rein hold shield in the frontline on the exact moment i need the extra healing to save an ally there is nothing i can do about it So i strongly suggest you guys put some thouht in some zenyatta perk that enables a more heal focus playstyle that dont bind my playmaking potential to the actions of the enemy Just to cement my point you guys are games designers so i believe you know that very popular simplification of the role trinity interaction tanks focus on enemy to ally interaction damage focus on ally to enemy interaction and suports focus on ally to ally interaction The zenyatta perk is at odds with this concept because it put an interaction with the enemy in between his primary way of interacting with his allies One idea of perk i have been considering for zenny is maybe a 25hp healing burst when harmony orb changes targets so zenny has to chose between keep shooting to maximise damage or keep switching orbs to maximise healing or even trying to keep the flow of animation canceling which would bring a cool new form of skill experssion but this post is not about ability theoricrafting so i digress Conclusion this posts is directly adressed to the devs but it is not a complaint neither is about balance suggestions This is strictily about the feel of some perks I dont think i know it all and i know that my suggestions are not perfect but i sincerely think that those are some bullet points that deserve to be at least taken into accont whenever the team is planning the perk refresh i know it is unlikely but still i hope some community manager can get this kind of feedback to the ear of the devs i have no data to prove that the points i raised affect many people but they are very relevant to my experience with the game and dont believe im totally alone on my perspectives sory for the bad

Support is the most overpowered role in entire game Its no surprise that supports have always been in a good spot in Overwatch from characters with 3 healthbars looking at you Baptiste to characters that have more damage than actual DPSs its safe to say that the role has always been the most overtuned atleast since the start of OW2 because thats when i started playing the game more often With the introduction of perks they made what was already broken even more broken It makes playing any other roles that isnt support a miserable experience most of the time because not only do they have the best abilities in the game they do what the DPSs can do but better Lets take a look at Kiriko for example She can 2 tap headshot 225 HP targets used to be most characters in the game before the season 9 hp changes with 0 falloff She also has an near instant TP that is undoubtedly the best movement ability in the game Aside from getting her out of any danger it also cleanses debuffs She has also wallclimb which helps her to get to high places and to survive longer like waiting for TP to come off cooldown for example She has the one of if not the best ability in the game with Suzu that completely voids ultimates Her ultimate is a teamfight win button Perks gave her a way to heal while still doing her insane damage alongside double TP This is a hot take farfetched and all but Kiriko really feels like a better version of Tracer even though one is a DPS and the other is a support The difference is you dont need to have good mechanics on Kiriko when you just aim at head level and strafe accordingly you dont have to take as much risks to do damage because she has 0 falloff which makes her superior mobility even better because you dont need to use it to engage You dont need to aim to ult and it even wins fights on its own and cant be cancelled at all only if you REALLY mess up and ult infront of a doom with punch or something Its CRAZY that you can go full ego on anyone with Kiriko and get away with it Are you being forced out Dont worry just press SHIFT Its only a 7 second cooldown You get the idea Most if not all support perks are simply straight upgrades to their already overloaded kit like Ana with 2 nades and 2 nanos for example I wouldnt mind this much if all heroes got the same treatment but its not equally distributed all around There are lots of characters that just got nichesituational perks such as Venture Support is easily the most babied role in the entire game not just from these perks alone but through the entirety of OW I could go on and on but i think you get the idea Id really like to see the dev team for once making actual impactful nerfs Start by removing the damage reduction from Anas nano on herself for example Give Kiriko faloff cast time on her TP suzu nerfs etc etc I am glad that they are listening because if the DPS passive from Season 9 arguably the only good thing about that patch wasnt implemented it would be a complete nightmare What do you think Should the role stay as it is or does it need changes,Support is the most overpowered role in entire game Its no surprise that supports have always been in a good spot in Overwatch from characters with 3 healthbars looking at you Baptiste to characters that have more damage than actual DPSs its safe to say that the role has always been the most overtuned atleast since the start of OW2 because that s when i started playing the game more often With the introduction of perks they made what was already broken even more broken It makes playing any other roles that is nt support a miserable experience most of the time because not only do they have the best abilities in the game they do what the DPSs can do but better Lets take a look at Kiriko for example She can 2 tap headshot 225 HP targets used to be most characters in the game before the season 9 hp changes with 0 falloff She also has an near instant TP that is undoubtedly the best movement ability in the game Aside from getting her out of any danger it also cleanses debuffs She has also wallclimb which helps her to get to high places and to survive longer like waiting for TP to come off cooldown for example She has the one of if not the best ability in the game with Suzu that completely voids ultimates Her ultimate is a teamfight win button Perks gave her a way to heal while still doing her insane damage alongside double TP This is a hot take farfetched and all but Kiriko really feels like a better version of Tracer even though one is a DPS and the other is a support The difference is you do nt need to have good mechanics on Kiriko when you just aim at head level and strafe accordingly you do nt have to take as much risks to do damage because she has 0 falloff which makes her superior mobility even better because you do nt need to use it to engage You do nt need to aim to ult and it even wins fights on its own and ca nt be cancelled at all only if you REALLY mess up and ult infront of a doom with punch or something Its CRAZY that you can go full ego on anyone with Kiriko and get away with it Are you being forced out Do nt worry just press SHIFT Its only a 7 second cooldown You get the idea Most if not all support perks are simply straight upgrades to their already overloaded kit like Ana with 2 nades and 2 nanos for example I would nt mind this much if all heroes got the same treatment but its not equally distributed all around There are lots of characters that just got nichesituational perks such as Venture Support is easily the most babied role in

introduction perk break broken play role support miserable experience time good ability game dps Lets look Kiriko example 2 tap headshot 225 HP target use character game season 9 hp change 0 falloff near instant tp undoubtedly good movement ability game aside danger cleanse debuff wallclimb help high place survive long like wait TP come cooldown example good ability game Suzu completely voids ultimate ultimate teamfight win button Perks way heal insane damage alongside double tp hot farfetched Kiriko feel like version Tracer DPS support difference need good mechanic Kiriko aim head level strafe accordingly risk damage 0 falloff superior mobility need use engage need aim ult win fight cancel mess ult infront doom punch CRAZY ego Kiriko away force worry press SHIFT 7 second cooldown idea support perk simply straight upgrade overload kit like Ana 2 nade 2 nano example mind hero treatment equally distribute lot character nichesituational perk Venture Support easily babied role entire game perk entirety OW think idea d like dev team actual impactful nerfs Start remove damage reduction Anas nano example Kiriko faloff cast time tp suzu nerfs etc etc glad listen dps passive Season 9 arguably good thing patch implement complete nightmare think role stay need change

ChangesAddictions I would like to see This is not about balance just changes that might improve the user experience focused on the more casual players Free lootbox for playing the least played role Like it was before Overwatch 2 Now we get 500xp which is basically nothing And now that lootboxes are back this feature might as well get reimplemented Classic skins for every OW1 hero gets their old spawnselect voice line Eg Dva I play to win DF Only through conflict do we evolve etc Gives more reason to select those skins and it would be a nice throwback And we know this should be relatively easy to implement since OW Classic used these voice lines as well Perks in While you wait When your queueing for a game and you enter Skirmish or Deathmatch you should start at Perk lv3 So you can try them out against other players while waiting for your next loss in Comp wink Perks in Deathmatch I was really surprised to see that they arent available here Might be because of balance since some perks are useless without a team But the same is mostly true right now for certain characters Mercy Assault2CP back in QP map pool Because Clash was removed from Comp I see no reason to not add them back to QP as well OW Classic made me realise that I missed those maps and playing them every now and then isnt so bad Matches on those maps usually dont last that long anyway so they are easy points towards weekly challenges And since map votes will be coming people who dont like them could always vote for other maps Also it would be the first time we can properly test them in a 5v5 122 format

Hot take Hot take ball and doom are egregiously overpowered until you run Sombra With the perks its especially ball but I maintain this opinion for both characters Heres where Im coming from by all means wrecking ball and doom are ridiculously difficult to play and some of the hardest characters in a game Their skill ceiling knows almost no limits But they both have an extremely annoying frustrating ability For ball this is his adaptive shields that give him health and for doom its his empowered punch I cant help but feel like these abilities are too strong because ball gets infinite uptime from it and doom gets crazy output if people shoot his punch which is extra extra annoying because you might not be shooting his punch it might be ur 400 overloaded torb charging it but then 3 seconds later youre the 250hp squishie that pays the price Heres the catch Sombra basically denies their entire character which is conversely really frustrating for doom and ball players The result is either you dont go Sombra and theyre extremely oppressive or you go Sombra and they become utterly useless unless they majorly skill diff the Sombra I think ball and doom need power shifted from these abilities to other parts of their kit such that they can still maintain good output even with a Sombra on the team but they dont feel annoying to deal with when there is no Sombra on the team I think everyone would prefer this Edit to add a lot of people are saying that Sombra is not oppressive or that hero x y or z is more oppressive than Sombra but this only makes my point more pertinent these heroes are still really strong and oppressive en masse until you run one hero that shuts them down entirely and then theyre useless which is poor design that sucks for balldoom players and also for

Perks blocking my mouse during games Had this for a while and thought it could be my laptops fault but I checked absolutely everything even contacted the blizzard support and found nothing that could help The season 15 is making me cry Perks are cool but only if I could actually play when I have them Managed to record this yesterday while playing Mercy thats the only one I can actually play without being scared of not being able to move in the middle of a game had to use Valk randomly to be helpful that was terrible but actually happens with any other hero in general For example happened during a 1v1 against a Widow and my forehead paid the price later When I get a perk my mouse instantly starts missing pixels and nothing works cant aim correctly can barely look around As you can see it immediately happens as soon as I get the perk Then when I take one its going back to normal Most of the time I try to take the perk as quick as I can but sometimes especially in comp I cant allow myself to stop randomly to take it My mouse is all good it never happens in other games and sometimes it doesnt even happen But when it does its always about perks So Id like to know since Blizzard cant actually answer if anyone is also facing this problem and eventually found a solution I would love to hear it because its actually ruining my games I know touching grass wouldnt hurt me but hey still Thank you a lot will really appreciate any help because I really dont know what to do,Perks blocking my mouse during games Had this for a while and thought it could be my laptops fault but I

Lifeweaver Rework Concept Thorn Gun Add a variation of his current Superbloom perk to the base behaviour of the gun Instead of triggering explosions per hit trigger them when weaver reloads damaging based on how many needles have hit Need more needles to do max damage versus a tank in role queue Superbloom finally adds something interesting to his gun that makes his character mildly interesting to shoot with Lean into it Healing Blossoms Reduce clip size to 4 Heal instantly for 20 then 50 for 2s Reloads naturally over time like Doomfist primary Charging the thorns no longer increases their heal but instead makes them reload faster Lets face it Weavers current healing loop is boring has no skill expression involved and prevents him from doing more interesting things with his time Giving him a much smaller regenerating clip size to manage would add resource management while also freeing him up to shoot more often rather than locking him into the charging and releasing loop constantly It would also help him to compete with Brigitte as a support pairing for Genji Tracer and Echo Life Grip Reworked to be functionally similar to a Zarya bubble cleansing its target then protecting them from damage Absorbs up to 125 damage on its target and lasts up to 225 seconds When broken pulls the target to Lifeweaver Environmental damage that would otherwise be lethal just breaks the bubble and triggers the pull Implementation detail happens in two steps first to the location where they were the button was pressed then to the location weaver was when he pressed it Avoids issues with LOS when the target goes around corners Weaver needs something with proactive potential in his kit which this would provide by allowing him to use it on DPS heroes to execute high risk dives with safety It would be more interactive for enemies since if it was poorly timed they could just wait out the bubble to be able to kill its target Alternatively breaking the bubble would force out the bubbled target offering some counterplay to its dives Tree of Life Conversion rate of health to overhealth is 11 First pulse now heals everyone to full and grants the full overhealth Successive pulses unchanged This ultimate is just underpowered This would at least make it halfway decent at saving people and remotely comparable to Brigittes rally Petal platform is fine Minor Perks Replace Cleansing Grip Gripped targets gain healing and a speed boost after pull ends Replace Life Cycle Roots of life A long wall of roots sprouts in front of Lifeweaver continuing until it hits a wall The first perk solves a major issue for weaver which is that pulling your teammates to safety makes your team fight 4v5 for a few seconds while the saved hero rejoins the fight A few seconds can often matter especially when the tank is the one being pulled This makes it easier for them to run back into the fight as fast as possible The second option modifies the ultimate to lean into the potential of using it as a wall Currently its shape means that it can only wall off targets in a very limited set of areas A wall emerging from weaver and extending as far as it needs to extend would both make it easier to fight inside the area of effect of the healing easier to place it in a way that covers your whole team and easier to break up the fight to trap enemies with it In Lifeweaver spirit it would also make it easier to accidentally fuck over a teammate This one is potentially extremely powerful but as an ultimate based perk it will only be used a handful of times per game Major Perks Replace Life weaving Triggering a max damage superbloom heals Lifeweaver and restores healing blossom charges Replace superbloom Reduce healing blossom capacity to three and slow their passive regeneration but blossoms now bounce to a second teammate The first option heavily improves the healing output of DPS weaver by providing sustain when he engages divers or during brawls The second option lets

I was wrong about perks When perks dropped I made a post venting my frustrations with the new system Having played the game much more since then Ill admit I was mostly wrong I still maintain that some of the perks are ridiculously unbalanced and that overall its going to be a nightmare for the team to balance in the future but I really dont hate it as much as I did on launch It definitely takes some getting used to I still freeze up for a moment whenever I unlock my perks but I really dont mind it that much aside from that Assuming perks get balanced in some way and the system gets tweaked a little bit I dont think Ill stop playing Overwatch because of it Im relieved to be able to play the game without feeling too disillusioned I still think it was wild to shove perks straight into comp without a grace period to get used to them but were all in the same boat on that I suppose How are other people finding perks now weve had more time to get used to them,I was wrong about perks When perks dropped I made a post venting my frustrations with the new system Having played the game much more since then Ill admit I was mostly wrong I still maintain that some of the perks are ridiculously unbalanced and that overall its going to be a nightmare for the team to balance in the future but I really do nt hate it as much as I did on launch It definitely takes some getting used to I still freeze up for a moment whenever I unlock my perks but I really do nt mind it that much aside from that Assuming perks get balanced in some way and the system gets tweaked a little bit I do nt think Ill stop playing Overwatch because of it I m relieved to be able to play the game without feeling too disillusioned I still think it was wild to shove perks straight into comp without a grace period to get used to them but were all in the same boat on that I suppose How are other people finding perks now we ve had more time to get used to them,I be wrong about perk when perk drop I make a post vent my frustration with the new system having play the game much more since then Ill admit I be mostly wrong I still maintain that some of the perk be ridiculously unbalanced and that overall its go to be a nightmare for the team to balance in the future but I really do not hate it as much as I do on launch it definitely take some getting use to I still freeze up for a moment whenever I unlock my perk but I really do not mind it that much aside from that assume perk get balanced in some way and the system get tweak a little bit I do not think Ill stop play overwatch because of it I m relieve to be able to play the game without feel too disillusioned I still think it be wild to shove perk straight into comp without a grace period to get use to they but be all in the same boat on that I suppose how be other people find perk now we ve have more time to get use to they,wrong perk perk drop post vent frustration new system having play game Ill admit wrong maintain perk ridiculously unbalanced overall nightmare team balance future hate launch definitely getting use freeze moment unlock perk mind aside assume perk balanced way system tweak little bit think Ill stop play overwatch m relieve able play game feel disillusioned think wild shove perk straight comp grace period use boat suppose people find perk ve time use

My confession My name is Winton Hartwell Overwat I live at 123 Amarillo Banana Lane Watchpoint Gibraltar Spain 69420 This is my obsession If youre playing this game you probably have no bitches Blizzard has been building a PC gaming empire for many years now and has been using OW as its esports flagship Shortly after OWs seventh year anniversary Bobby Kotick came to Team 4 with a rather shocking proposition He asked that they use their gaming knowledge to cook up a F2P model for their game which he would then use to sell Kiriko skins to gooners Gooners with seemingly infinite money I was astounded I I always thought that Blizzard was a company that put players first and I was thrown confused but the fans were particularly starved for content at the time something they knew and took advantage of They were reeling from a sexual assault lawsuit that was poised to bankrupt the company Bobby made Team 4 play Fortnite and showed them just how much money even a nonpredatory F2P game could make And they were weak They didnt want their company to go into financial ruin so they agreed Every day I think back to that moment with regret Team 4 quickly realized they were in way over their heads and Bobby had a partner a man named Armin Zerza a businessman Bobby essentially sold the dev team into servitude to this man and when they tried to quit Zerza threatened financial recourse They didnt know where to turn Eventually Bobby and the female Blizzard staff had a falling out From what I can gather Bobby was always pushing for a greater share of the breast milk to which the female staff flatly refused to give him and things escalated The state of California was able to arrange uh I guess I guess you call it a civil rights lawsuit on the corporation which succeeded and Blizzards reputation was seriously injured and they wound up paying restitutions which amounted to a little over 54 million Upon recovery Bobby was bent on recouping their losses working with a man named Aaron Keller he plotted to kill Overwatch League and did so In fact the league that he killed was devised by Bobby himself and he gave the teams no option in it I have often contemplated quitting the game but I am a coward I wanted to go touch grass but I was frightened Overwatch had risen in the ranks to become the top hero shooter and about that time to keep the game fresh they took the sixth teammate away from players For 2 years they kept it 5v5 My duo who up to that point had no idea of my toxic team chat activities was horrified to learn what slurs I used why I got banned for two weeks We were scared I was in Hell I hated Blizzard for what they had done to my teambased hero shooter Recently I tried once again to quit to end this nightmare and in response they gave us perks I cant take this anymore I live in fear the day that Overwatch will permaban me or worse stop making Kiriko skins I all I could think to do was to make this reddit post in hope that the world will finally see this monke for what he really is,My confession My name is Winton Hartwell Overwat I live at 123 Amarillo Banana Lane Watchpoint Gibraltar Spain 69420 This is my obsession If you re playing

What I think this game needs3 Whats Fun 1 Destruction of structures breaking things walls Is it possible to make the current maps breakable on some walls etc Not total overhaul of game 2 Is it possible to mirror the payload maps So Players go the reverse direction with Payload It would play differently 3 we Need to be paid with more token for Losing in Competitive This game has made me Sick literally After 45 minutes and a lost match in overtime Those times when why did one of my teammates leave when we are winning in those extra rounds The one1 point of 30 points system Is The ONLY reasonI didnt stop playing years ago Issue is Max out to the system is at 3k comp points so after the Max Im Done until next season 4 Alsoadd a way to earn more retro comp points Point system like Lose10 tie25 50 for win So what if everyone has a Gold nowadays Players enjoy the characters more with weapon skins and grinding to goals The prestige of owning gold isnt as spectacular as it was so many years ago Value Players timemusk Value my time Because a game over 30 mins and a Loss in competitive has me quitting the game for the day or for weeks Would like to be able earn weapons camos for all heros Again Im sorry for the long post Love Diva 5 Ahh Mystery heros allow us to pick our own perks wtf was that decision Thank you for the years of Toxic anger Im stuck healing noobs and lose 55 percent of my games Open queue gold tank and dps gold Bronze And silver stuck on Support I know its the team 1 in 5 tankdps can actually play 6 please look at your matchmaker again because it still isnt fair Im supposed to heal and save the noobs nope not me anymore Too many games and years of nursing I actually like playing support for non Bots Now playing for the loot boxes and stop playing until the next week So thats my time into it Comp playlist until get my loot boxes done The new Camo not worth the time of 130 and over 300 games Perks had me check out the game again The Halloween event had meaningful changes What happened got scared that the Balancing would be off Ok make it a separate list Because yes the game wasnt built around perks tell me is it a penalty to counter swap to have to wait to get perks again or Chose wrong one perks Last 7 punishment for leaving is stupid not having to play more of the game you want players playing Right Are you trolling yourself here

Korea and China should swap for next stage Its been clear since the start of OWCS that the top two of Asia would be the same as the top two of Korea The fact that every single Asia Main Event has gone exactly this way proves it Do we really need to see the best 4 teams in Korea completely destroy the best 2 teams in the Pacific and Japan on repeat every stage All this leads to is seeing the same four Korea teams play each other over and over and over again We see the same four teams play each other in the Korea Group Stage Korea Seeding Stage Korea Playoffs Asia Group Stage Asia Playoffs Dont get me wrong I enjoy watching the best teams in the world play Overwatch at the highest level but do we really need to see WAY play against Team Falcons 7 or 8 times in the span of two months After this stage well get a better feel for how China as a region is able to stack up globally and I fully believe that the best China team will be competitive against the best Korea teams but wouldnt it be so much better if China took Koreas place in the Asia Region The Chinese teams can battle it out against the Pacific and Japan teams which would almost certainly lead to more competitive matches than with Korea Just give Korea two spots at LAN determined by the Korea Playoffs The end product would probably be the same with two Korea teams and two Chinese teams but there would be a bigger

Havent played the game in a long time what happened to using mics and communicating with your team Me and my friend picked up OW2 again recently after not playing for years been having a lot of fun with the new characters and perk system We mainly play competitive and after placing silver kinda rusty lol and grinding through to plat we log in to find myself muted from all communications for 2 weeks and my friend banned from playing for 2 weeks We play the game with our mics openI remember back in its heyday people were always on comms and generally were pretty willing to talk out tactics and coordinate during a match even in quick play Now we get one person using their mic every 5 games or so if were lucky We do always encourage people to join vc in the text chat too and even when they do it usually just means they hear what we say but do not speak themselves Like I said we keep mics open so offhand remarks about needing heals or asking what our teammates are doing are heard by everyone I do vocally thank healers and call out good plays and generally we try to encourage our team to work together and do a good job But when noone is willing to communicate verbally people seem to take these suggestions the wrong way as personal criticism when its more thinking out loud than anything and trying to keep everyone on the same page Ie asking an Ana to hold her nano a little later next time instead of using it on me when my ult is at 90 It just seems like a lot of people are very quick to report now and the report system does seem to be very harsha 2 week communications ban is wild especially when im usually the only one trying to communicate Now I cant even attempt to coordinate with my team It feels like Im being punished for engaging with the communication systems instead of other players being punished for refusing to communicate if that makes sense Idk I feel like using a mic should be expected especially in ranked and even if not why report players that are very transparent about wanting better communication and participation with their team I have never reported anyone in this game for any reason other than sandbagging or intentional throwing If a tank asking for better communication with their healers bothers some people just mute me Why report if Im just trying to help us win This turned into a kind of huge rant but its very frustrating that most players these days are not willing to cooperate or communicate and it ends up punishing the players that do try Maybe its just me but I feel like its much harder to win a match when noone wants to talk and I jsut miss when people in this game actually did talk to each other I feel like the social element has completely disappeared,Have nt played the game in a long time what happened to using

Moving Barrage shouldnt be a perk One of Pharahs minor perks needs to be reworked The ability to move during barrage is too good and Im pretty confident its the overwhelming choice among players certainly among pros There have been a lot of games where I hold barrage until I hit 23 more rockets just so it isnt an instant death button Minor perks are supposed to come up around your first ultimate anyways so it feels like its always better than the alternative The shields perk isnt even that bad it was a nice buffer using it in Junkenstiens Lab but its just not as useful as its alternative Moreover idk how you really tune either in any direction to try and balance them You could scrap the shields perk and just go for another more equal alternative but were I the devs Id just make moving barrage part of the kit since its so common now anyways and give her a different minor perk If everyone takes moving barrage and its almost always available by the first ult anyways I think it should just be a QoL change Not that Pharah needs buffs in my opinion What other perks are so ubiquitously good QoL and hard to balance that they should just be a part of the base kit Overload reloading rivet gun ammo comes to mind,Moving Barrage should nt be a perk One of Pharahs minor perks needs to be reworked The ability to move during barrage is too good and I m pretty confident its the overwhelming choice among players certainly among pros There have been a lot of games where I hold barrage until I hit 23 more rockets just so it is nt an instant death button Minor perks are supposed to come up around your first ultimate anyways so it feels like its always better than the alternative The shields perk is nt even that bad it was a nice buffer using it in Junkenstiens Lab but its just not as useful as its alternative Moreover idk how you really tune either in any direction to try and balance them You could scrap the shields perk and just go for another more equal alternative but were I the devs I d just make moving barrage part of the kit since its so common now anyways and give her a different minor perk If everyone takes moving barrage and its almost always available by the first ult anyways I think it should just be a QoL change Not that Pharah needs buffs in my opinion What other perks are so ubiquitously good QoL and hard to balance that they should just be a part of the base kit Overload reloading rivet gun ammo comes to mind,move Barrage should not be a perk one of Pharahs minor perk need to be rework the ability to move during barrage be too good and I m pretty confident its the overwhelming choice among player certainly among pro there have be a lot of game where I hold barrage until I hit 23 more rocket just so it be not an instant death button minor perk be suppose to come up around your first ultimate anyways so it feel like its always well than the alternative the shield perk be not even that bad it be a nice buffer use it in Junkenstiens Lab but its just not as useful as its alternative moreover idk how you really tune either in any direction to try and balance they you could scrap the shield perk and just go for another more equal alternative but be I the devs I d just make move barrage part of the kit since its so common now anyways and give she a different minor perk if everyone take move barrage and its almost always available by the first ult anyways I think it should just be a qol change not that Pharah need buff in my opinion what other perk be so ubiquitously good qol and hard to balance that they should just be a part of the base kit overload reloading rivet gun ammo come to mind,Barrage perk Pharahs minor perk need rework ability barrage good m pretty confident overwhelming choice player certainly pro lot game hold barrage hit 23 rocket instant death button minor perk suppose come ultimate anyways feel like alternative shield perk bad nice buffer use Junkenstiens Lab useful alternative idk tune direction try balance scrap shield perk equal alternative devs d barrage kit common anyways different minor perk barrage available ult anyways think qol change Pharah need buff opinion perk ubiquitously good qol hard balance base kit overload reloading rivet gun ammo come mind

disappointing mid season patch first of all rn im a genji soj echo pharah player for the most part genji and soj are BUSTED the latter a lot more than the former but we asked for different genji perks because they were boring as uninspiring instead we got straight buffs to three of them sojourn is by far the best dps in the game and she went untouched anas perks have been the most complained about because of how op they are and she went untouched meis wall perk was 100 useless and had a gigantic downside to it now its just useless for the non mei players you could go literal weeks if not months before this perk is useful even a single time its great for griefing though long ass wall on spawn doors torb got nerfed rightfully so but tracer who was already running rampart with her op perks went untouched glad for this ig but still not healthy especially when they didnt do anything to make flashback not the obvious choice echo went unchanged despite being underwhelming and with dogshit major perks pharah got a big buff to her unpopular minor while her two extremely powerful other perks went untouched personally i think vacuum blast is too fun and way too op but i play pharah so rams shield perk is garbage game design like spilo said its not engaging at all sombra had four actual dogshit perks and now only three of them are dogshit will have to test stack overflows new range but this shit is a loselose scenario its either still worthless garbage or it isnt and everyone has less fun playing ow getting hacked for twice the duration because of extremely lazy game design hog and winston buffs are just brainless number increases for two perks that are gonna go unused anyway because they are niche and boring juno got a buff because if theres one thing juno needed was a buff a handful of good changes here like for lw and illari but overall im disappointed in the lack of effort and vision and in particular of the extreme power creep nothing good comes out of that garbage it gave us goats it gave us double shield it gave us mei reaper it gave us double shield annihilating the chances for long term balance so they can get short term gratification buffing everyone and their

I suspect Blizzards balance team has hero favorites dont they Its undeniable that compared to OW1 highrank matches in OW2 are no longer mirror compositions But looking at balance patches from the last year or two Ive noticed developers tend to keep certain heroes perpetually in top positions Despite these heroes being widely acknowledged as overpowered developers wont take action especially with Ana I dont know how long this old cute lady has dominated the competitive ladder but after introducing perks her perk might have given her the biggest boost in the game Clearly developers have never considered reducing her terrifying pick rate Since OW2 launched Anas only period of weakness came during Season 9 when healing reduction mechanics were introduced but subsequently her biotic grenade was buffed to 90 damage The latest balance patch makes this phenomenon increasingly intolerable Developers previously admitted that Pharah and Ana benefited most from perks so why havent they been restricted Pharah even received buffs along with heroes like Genji who are clearly not underpowered Meanwhile Torbjrn who had just recently started showing potential was immediately nerfed Whats the basis for their balancing decisions Similarly with Lifeweaver developers have never stopped buffing her to increase his play rate and this patch continues that trend What about Moira and Mercy dont they deserve significant buffs to make them viable options The design philosophy behind perks is also laughable I suspect they didnt even hold a meeting to discuss the design approach Many heroes have completely different design principles For example Ana received substantial improvements without any tradeoffs like getting two Nano Boosts without reducing duration Some heroes make sacrifices for their perks like Sombra and Junkrat And some heroes changes are so ridiculous they seem like April Fools mode If they rushed these perks to production just to create socalled internet buzz at their spotlight event thats somewhat understandable but its been over a month havent they had time to establish unified principles and standards for perk design,I suspect Blizzards balance team has hero

Is the casual playerbase overblowing Zaryas strength or am I just going insane Before I begin I do want to quickly mention that I do not want to sound elitist or come off with the skill issue type of argument here Zarya in her current state is undoubtedly one the stronger tanks right and I have been seeing a ton of Zarya doing good work all across every game Ive played this season However what boggles me is that a lot of the casual playerbase seems to argue that she is the single strongest tank currently and that she with Sojourn which is more understandable is ruining every ranked game While I understand shes undoubtedly strong personally playing Zarya myself I really dont see what makes her suddenly stronger than in previous seasons when her balance state was almost identical She didnt receive any significant buffs in the previous seasons Her perks while undoubtedly good are not so impactful that it flips her counter matchup nor does it massively fix her natural kit issues taking high ground quickly low personal mobility Anecdotally while she is definitely on the stronger side of tanks playing tank myself Ive never felt the urgent need to swap heroes just to counter the Zarya ALONE if Im swapping its always because of the tank mismatch with the Zaryas DPS line instead Standard tank heroes like Hazard Winston Mauga Ramattra Ball and even DVa on high ground maps all have either neutral or favorable matchups and I never had significant issues playing into Zarya with most of these heroes if me and my team is playing somewhat competently Finally if anything Mauga currently is by far the most excruciating tank in a matchup when youre facing a halfway competent one since his kit design is so naturally oppressive to a majority of the tank cast in his current balanced state Yet I have yet to see any major complaints on the hero Would love to hear some thoughts on this EDIT Quick edit here when I say I dont see major complaints about Mauga Im referring primarily to the casual playerbase and their primary focus on Zarya over Mauga which I believe is significantly more oppressive and frustrating to play against than Zarya,Is the casual playerbase

Freja and the content flood There was a thread made recently asking why there didnt seem to be any hype around Freja Several comments pointed to her safe design and kit which I dont think is a fair thing to say before we get a chance to play her Especially with her unique mobility we all know how many subtle nuances can hide deep within a kit like that OW1 trailed at the end with the infamous content drought but I think Frejas lack of attention is a symptom of the exact opposite content flood I mean just look at everything thats happened in that last few months Perks Stadium reveal and streamer test Freja reveal and streamer test LLE SERAFIM collab 6v6 test Perks again after a huge patch And to emphasize the perks most of them offer fundamental changes to how a hero plays so its like were rediscovering each of these heroes and then had to do so yet again at the big patch on the 18th And the 6v6 tests have caused many big streamers to give the game a try again so twitch and youtube enjoyers have a proper deluge of content to catch up on there not to mention OWCS dropping some BANGER matches the last few weeks and like 4 rounds of Twitch drops both for general OW and OWCS cosmetics For those of us who get really into the nittygritty parts of the scene theres a HUGE abundance of dev interviews to claw through And then we follow all that up with a Freja Story trailer AND comic reading yesterday and its like thats so great I have no bad feelings about that But let me go grab a powernap first lol Truly I kinda gave myself a headache listing everything out cause its just so much to love all at once and were barely getting started Stadium drops in a month or perhaps mid season 16 Im not sure and its poised to be the most fascinating and highesteffort thing Blizzard has done so far Honestly even bigger than a new hero Freja is great I love Frejas kit and her design has a lot of cool things going for it Its just that shes standing next to a MOUNTAIN of similarlycool shit Theres no lack of hype But there are way more places to put our hype than were used too Edit I just realized the Freja playtest starts today Im actually gonna go into a contentcoma Aaron please slow down Im begging you,Freja and the content flood There was a thread made recently asking why there did nt seem to be any hype around Freja Several comments pointed to her safe design and kit which I do nt think is a fair thing to say before we get a chance to play her Especially with her unique mobility we all know how many subtle nuances can hide deep within a kit like that OW1 trailed at the end with the infamous content drought but I think Frejas lack of attention is a symptom of the exact opposite content flood I mean just look at everything that s happened in that last few months Perks Stadium reveal and streamer test Freja reveal and streamer test LLE SERAFIM collab 6v6 test Perks again after a huge patch And to emphasize the perks most of them offer fundamental changes to how a hero plays so its like were rediscovering each of these heroes and then had to do so yet again at the big patch on the 18th And the 6v6 tests have caused many big streamers to give the game a try again so twitch and youtube enjoyers have a proper deluge of content to catch up on there not to mention OWCS dropping some BANGER matches the last few weeks and like 4 rounds of Twitch drops both for general OW and OWCS cosmetics For those of us who get really into the nittygritty parts of the scene there s a HUGE abundance of dev interviews to claw through And then we follow all that up with a Freja Story trailer AND comic reading yesterday and its like that s so great I have no bad feelings about that But let me go grab a powernap first lol Truly I kinda gave myself a headache listing everything out cause its just so much to love all at once and were barely getting started Stadium drops in a month or perhaps mid season 16 I m not sure and its poised to be the most fascinating and highesteffort thing Blizzard has done so far Honestly even bigger than a new hero Freja is great I love Frejas kit and her design has a lot of cool things going for it Its just that she s standing next to a MOUNTAIN of similarlycool shit There s no lack of hype But there are way more places to put our hype than were used too Edit I just realized the Freja playtest starts today I m actually gon

Why does the current 6V6 competitive test not use the exact same balance as the previous tests Im not really referring to the health pool stuff because yes that is the same for tanks as previous tests but they made such a big deal out of the separate balance for 6v6 compared to 5v5 reverting Roadhog Rein losing 1 fire streak and getting 2000 HP shield etc but now every hero is just their 5v5 versions plopped into 6v6 Is there a reason they made this change Is it because of perks Couldnt they just introduce new perks for the previous 6v6 versions of the heroes,Why does the current 6V6 competitive test not use the exact same balance as the previous tests I m not really referring to the health pool stuff because yes that is the same for tanks as previous tests but they made such a big deal out of the separate balance for 6v6 compared to 5v5 reverting Roadhog Rein losing 1 fire streak and getting 2000 HP shield etc but now every hero is just their 5v5 versions plopped into 6v6 Is there a reason they made this change Is it because of perks Could nt they just introduce new perks for the previous 6v6 versions of the heroes,why do the current 6v6 competitive test not use the exact same balance as the previous test I m not really refer to the health pool stuff because yes that be the same for tank as previous test but they make such a big deal out of the separate balance for 6v6 compare to 5v5 revert Roadhog Rein lose 1 fire streak and get 2000 HP shield etc but now every hero be just their 5v5 version plop into 6v6 be there a reason they make this change be it because of perk could not they just introduce new perk for the previous 6v6 version of the hero,current 6v6 competitive test use exact balance previous test m refer health pool stuff yes tank previous test big deal separate balance 6v6 compare 5v5 revert Roadhog Rein lose 1 fire streak 2000 HP shield etc hero 5v5 version plop 6v6 reason change perk introduce new perk previous 6v6 version hero

leveling up to get perks is such a shoot yourself in the foot design So much wasted potential I still remember a month or two ago when teams were trying out bastion on esperanca They were only picking bastion for his linholm explosive perk but the perk came in so late that all those teams just ended up having a useless character for 34 of the match I do admit that bastion did find some decent value with the perk but its situational and not enough to compensate for the lack of value that made up 34 of the match Ive never been a supporter of perks I think giving players agency in how they want to approach their characters is a great concept but tying it to a leveling system is just stupid I guarantee you bastion would see a lot more playtime in pro matches if bastion gets to switch between his normal machine gun and linholm explosive at the beginning of the match It adds choices and utility into his kit I think the same thing goes for other characters that have perks that can change your playstyle For example sombra Why cant we just rework her and have white hat as a part of her passiveand we can maybe tone down other oppressive parts in compensation Its such a wasted potential For other characters with perks that compensate their weaknesses I think we should also just have them as actual passive instead of a perk that will only be triggered after 34 of a match For example the reaper rightclick perk I agree it would be a bit to strong to be a passive from the start of the game but with some nerfs to it I think it would make reapers gameplay a lot more dynamic and flexible Its just a wasted potential The same goes for rams vortex perk If ram has it from the start of a match he would be able to deny other heroes high ground a lot morelike how he was advertised as a pharah counter before release and the vortex could be used more strategically,leveling up to get perks is such a shoot yourself in the foot design So much wasted potential I still remember a month or

Should DIRE TRIGGERS be moved to Reapers base kit This question appeared in my head yesterday when I tried to play Reaper a bit yesterday We were waiting for a rework of this hero for quite some time and recently the devs answered its no longer the priority The perk with alt fire gives him option to deal some dmg at range which was always his biggest problem and which I think they were trying to fix Alt fire is fun to use especially after the balance patch that reduced the recovery time adds some more depth to the hero and flows really well with the rest of his abilites something that I cannot say about Reins shield bash for example I feel like its one of the best perks introduced the other major perk is really good too but I think I will be picking Dire Triggers a lot more just to have that other button to press So if the perk is so nice why not just move it to the base kit Similarly I really like the needler perk for Lifeweaver but here his kit has already a lot of things going on I understand why its a perk For Reaper though he is one of the earilest heroes who has been really outkitted by the rest of the cast and if he is meta its usually just thanks to the stats This could give the devs another thing to tune in terms of balance and if we need new perks I would focus on giving the alt fire some different effects tightening the spread even more or adding a bleed effect to it idk,Should DIRE TRIGGERS be moved to Reapers base kit This question appeared in my head yesterday when I tried to play Reaper a bit yesterday We were waiting for a rework of this hero for quite some time and recently the devs answered its no longer the priority The perk with alt fire gives him option to deal some dmg at range which was always his biggest problem and which I think they were trying to fix Alt fire is fun to use especially after the balance patch that reduced the recovery time adds some more depth to the hero and flows really well with the rest of his abilites something that I can not say about Reins shield bash for example I feel like its one of the best perks introduced the other major perk is really good too but I think I will be picking Dire Triggers a lot more just to have that other button to press So if the perk is so nice why not just move it to the base kit Similarly I really like the needler perk for Lifeweaver but here his kit has already a lot of things going on I understand why its a perk For Reaper though he is one of the earilest heroes who has been really outkitted by the rest of the cast and if he is meta its usually just thanks to the stats This could give the devs another thing to tune in terms of balance and if we need new perks I would focus on giving the alt fire some different effects tightening the spread even more or adding a bleed effect to it idk,should DIRE trigger be move to Reapers base kit this question appear in my head yesterday when I try to play Reaper a bit yesterday we be wait for a rework of this hero for quite some time and recently the devs answer its no long the priority the perk with alt fire give he option to deal some dmg at range which be always his big problem and which I think they be try to fix alt fire be fun to use especially after the balance patch that reduce the recovery time add some more depth to the hero and flow really well with the rest of his abilite something that I can not say about Reins shield bash for example I feel like its one of the good perk introduce the other major perk be really good too but I think I will be pick Dire Triggers a lot more just to have that other button to press so if the perk be so nice why not just move it to the base kit similarly I really like the needler perk for Lifeweaver but here his kit have already a lot of thing go on I understand why its a perk for reaper though he be one of the earil hero who have be really outkitte by the rest of the cast and if he be meta its usually just thank to the stat this could give the devs another thing to tune in term of balance and if we need new perk I would focus on give the alt fire some different effect tighten the spread even more or add a bleed effect to it idk,DIRE trigger Reapers base kit question appear head yesterday try play Reaper bit yesterday wait rework hero time recently devs answer long priority perk alt fire option deal dmg range big problem think try fix alt fire fun use especially balance patch reduce recovery time add depth hero flow rest abilite Reins shield bash example feel like good perk introduce major perk good think pick Dire Triggers lot button press perk nice base kit similarly like needler perk Lifeweaver kit lot thing understand perk reaper earil hero outkitte rest cast meta usually thank stat devs thing tune term balance need new perk focus alt fire different effect tighten spread add bleed effect idk
Freja 11 relative sens and other tidbits Changed number and added detail explained below Apologies Since Freja has a different zoom ratio than AsheAnaWidow she needs a different relative sens to get

A problematic meta has emerged in the metal ranks and possibly the higher ones as well The last two weeks and especially since the midseason patch a certain 4 hero lineup has emerged as having excessively strong synergy especially once perks come online This lineup is Zarya Genji Sojourn Ana What you have in this group is four individually strong heroes once perks come up especially Sojourn and Ana who are all built to enable and cover the weaknesses of Genji Genji goes from a strong but fair on his own with perks to utterly and completely unanswerable in this lineup Add Brigitte to the mix to help enable Genji and Soj from afar with her buffed repair packs while babysitting Ana and it becomes a complete deathball At the core of the strength of this four or five man lineup is one particular perk synergy Zars spotterGenjis thirstGenjis meditation Zars range enablement and Genjis self healing allows him to function as a miniature doomfist in what I can only describe as Ninja Goats Once nanoblade is online this perk synergy turns an already fight winning ult combo into an uncounterable one You cant interact with Genji in bubble he moves faster hes lifestealing while swinging and if you do burst through bubble he has meditation to momentarily sustain before continuing the onslaught while potentially receiving a second bubble in Zars cooldown cycle On top of all of this youll have to contend with 2 of Grav Overclock and Rally in the next team fight so this lineup will always feel like its winning ult economywise Fundamentally I think this game is in a good place metawise when high skill cap heroes like genji are good but you have to allow skillful counterplay against that strength and Zars excessively good enablement in her current iteration server admins and

adding the perks system to comp makes comp feel even more complex then it already was and thats not a good thing when considering they are adding new heroes too i took a long break from overwatch after playing consistently since ow1 launch and tbh the perks added to comp was a bad idea because it just makes everyone way to unpredictable to track and theres no sense of balance its ruined comp for me personally it feels incredibly gimmicky and not a place for comp at this point they are throwing shit to the wall and seeing what sticks but hopefully they remove this asap comp in high ranks were already quite complex in many different ways but now we have to worry about perks smh its way to hard to track time to not play this game anymore again,adding the perks system to comp makes comp feel even more complex then it already was and that s not a good thing when considering they are adding new heroes too i took a long break from overwatch after playing consistently since ow1 launch and tbh the perks added to comp was a bad idea because it just makes everyone way to unpredictable to track and there s no sense of balance its ruined comp for me personally it feels incredibly gimmicky and not a place for comp at this point they are throwing shit to the wall and seeing what sticks but hopefully they remove this asap comp in high ranks were already quite complex in many different ways but now we have to worry about perks smh its way to hard to track time to not play this game anymore again,add the perk system to comp make comp feel even more complex then it already be and that s not a good thing when consider they be add new hero too I take a long break from overwatch after play consistently since ow1 launch and tbh the perk add to comp be a bad idea because it just make everyone way to unpredictable to track and there s no sense of balance its ruin comp for I personally it feel incredibly gimmicky and not a place for comp at this point they be throw shit to the wall and see what stick but hopefully they remove this asap comp in high rank be already quite complex in many different way but now we have to worry about perk smh its way to hard to track time to not play this game anymore again,add perk system comp comp feel complex s good thing consider add new hero long break overwatch play consistently ow1 launch tbh perk add comp bad idea way unpredictable track s sense balance ruin comp personally feel incredibly gimmicky place comp point throw shit wall stick hopefully remove asap comp high rank complex different way worry perk smh way hard track time play game anymore

Frejas high SELFDamage makes little sense from both gameplay and lore perspectives Frejas right click explosion deals a maximum of 45 damage out of her 225 total health her bola deals up to 50 For

Freja is just a budget Sojourn Generally OW releases new characters in a pretty strong state To make a point of how insanely busted Sojourn still is today lets take a look at a the new character Freja in comparison to Sojourn 1 Mobility is very similar between the two I would argue that Sojurns is overall better because its both horizontal and vertical mobility in the same button Freja gets two dashes but with a perk Sojourn gets two slidesand her slide is overall fairly similar distance to two dashes from Freja Frejas hover mechanic is more of a liability than anything because of how much her movement is slowed but Sojourn can still stay mobile and right click after sliding and jumping 2 Frejas right click doesnt need charged and it isnt nearly as powerful as Sojourns Its a projectile so long range shots are not trivial and its damage cant one shot a character Sojourn right click will have a little bit more downtime than Frejas because it needs to charge but thats not really the major issue with Sojs kitits the one shot hitscan across the map 3 Frejas ult is pretty good but its fairly short duration and doesnt need to be respected as much as Sojourns Overclock lasts quite a long time and one shots squishies while Frejas feels more like a way to confirm kills I think Freja is a better character for the heath of the game overall than Sojourn or Widow Frejas right click reminds me of the event where Widow had a shoot delay extreme damage effect If they want Widow and Sojourn to remain how they are then I would expect some power creep where Frejas right click would do considerable more damage in exchange for less mobility I think it would be better to tune Widow and Sojourn down insteadI think she is fun to play but balance wise I guess lets see what they do for

Incorporating certain perks on base kit ideas and replacement ideas Certain perks feel like they should be incorporated into the base kit particularly if they are quality of life changes or add new abilities In addition to adding the perks to the base kit I will also balance them accordingly and give suggestions for the replacement While I do want to share my ideas I also want to hear your thoughts on these ideas both positive and negative Reaper Dire Triggers is now base kit but has a 6 second cooldown instead of 4 seconds This perk fixes Reapers biggest weakness and makes his gameplan way more fun and less painfully linear so Im puzzled as for why this is a major perk instead of minor let alone not base kit It was also just weird that he lacked a secondary fire until now and once he finally gets one its locked for most of the match The increased cooldown is in line with other cooldownbased damaging secondary fires like Orisa Echo and Soldier The replacement is Swift Step which replaces the 115 second animation before teleporting with a 0205 second wind up time I feel like Shadow Step is only good for rollouts but is pretty bad for escaping or using in the middle of the fight Making the teleport startup nearinstant makes it useful for teleporting behind enemies in the middle of a fight or as a backup escape if Wraith Form is on cooldown The short windup time still exists to make it fair but the goal is for teleporting to take less than a second since currently Shadow Step feels clunky Bastion Bastion like Reaper and Venture was missing an ability before perks SelfRepair is now a base kit ability but only heals 30 health per second without the perk and the current 90 with the perk 3x increase With the maximum heal being 33 seconds he can only heal 99 before recharging at base while he can heal 297 with the perk Since he lost self repair initially because he used to be overpowered the goal is to make the base heal not even able to heal half of his health at base without recharging but return it to its full heal power with the perk Additionally without the perk Bastions move speed is reduced by 35 without the perk but can move at normal speed during self repair with the perk a callback to how at launch Bastion was immobile while healing The new name is the least importamt part but I guess Improved Repair works Lifeweaver Lifeweaving is pretty underwhelming so it is now a minor perk replacing Cleansing Grasp which now exists at base even with it Lifeweaver is still just kind of a worse Kiriko The new major perk is Back to Normal which allows allies who had been life gripped to teleport back to the location they were gripped from 12 seconds after being gripped using the interact key a hologram shows during these 12 seconds so that both your team and the enemy know where youll be heading Its a pretty common occurence for a life grip to screw players out of a kill so giving players a choice to teleport back to their previous location would alleviate that issue I could see a teleport being too strong as a minor perk hence why I shuffled Lifeweaving around Roadhog This ones simple Scrap Hook now exists at base removing the requirement to reload if you unloaded all of your ammo The new perk with the same name just reloads all ammo instead of just 2 Its a similar situation to Torbs Fully Loaded which reloads 6 with base Overload and 18 with the perk Pharah Being able to move during Barrage should be a thing at base not a park Full movement is a bit too good at base so Pharah instead can move with a 50 penalty during Barrage while the perk gives her full movement speed again However Drift Thrusters now does a second thing Hover Jets regenerate at 10 fuel per second when falling a quarter of the 40 while on the ground Regenerating fuel in midair was an old feature which seems to be a running theme with perks I only made her regeneration 10 per second while in the air so shes not airborne all the time she can just stay in the air for longer Soldier 76 Soldier can reload while sprinting at base Simple quality of life change that should probably not be locked behind a perk Agility Training maintains its 20 faster sprint but the reload during sprint is replaced by being able to use Helix Rockets during Sprint Since its on a 6 second cooldown it shouldnt be too spammy Cassidy Okay this one isnt really adding the perk at base just taking what I like about the Quick Draw perk while hopefully fixing peoples issues with how the perk works At base Fan the Hammer can be cancelled with Primary Fire the primary use I get from Quick Draw is bursting with secondary first then primary for a faster kill With the perk holding down Secondary Fire continues using Fan the Hammer until the button is let go I see a lot of people complain about needing to repeatedly tap the button which is why holding allows for the old Fan the Hammer just with crits and less recoil,Incorporating certain perks on base kit

All changes made in the 6v6 test Spoiler Its not just the December 17th 2024 patch with perks EDIT 1 March 26th 2025 This post was made before the 25th of March 2025 hotfix patch this post is still useful if you want to see the original changes made to the current 6v6 test EDIT 2 April 5th 2025 I found some mistakes Ive made in my patch as well as some oversights so I updated the pastebin and the patch below to include all the changes I missed plus Ive managed to confirm other changes I couldnt before EDIT 3 April 9th 2025 Managed to finally confirm Tracers falloff range and its 1020 meters Additionally I checked for Widows projectile size on secondary fire and I am 90 sure it matches 5v5 live version EDIT 4 April 13th 2025 Hopefully this is my last update I found out the tank passive reduces ult charge generation by 20 down from 25 in the previous test Good evening Competitive Overwatch If you played the current form of the 6v6 test you probably noticed some differences between the version we played all the way back in December and the current test And no Im not just talking about perks rather the changes made to their base kits Intentional or not Blizzard have made changes to the heroes base kits especially tanks which mostly puts them in a unique balance spot between how they behaved in December and their current state in 5v5 midseason 15 So after a lot of testing myself with a friend I found most if not all of the changes made to this version of 6v6 It is also important to note that there are some changes I couldnt verify and they are written as such below I have made 2 versions of the list of changes one comparing it with the December 17th 2024 patch the other comparing it with the live version both written down as if they are blizzard patch notes The comparison between it and the live game will be written down in this post meanwhile the comparison between the original 6v6 patch will be written down in a pastebin Also none of the lists include perks due to the extra amount of time it would have taken me to test it as well as not feeling any different from my experiences And feel free to double check all of my findings andor point out any mistakes Ive made or even add to what I already have Lastly before reading all the changes I want to note that I am not a blizzard developer I have no idea if these changes were made intentionally or if they simply forgotten to change them in the first place maybe even both From what I know all of these changes could be patched out as a bug fix First 6v6 patch on December 17th 2024 if you need a refresher Patch comparison between the December 17th 2024 patch and this 6v6 test NOTE Most of the changes overall are reverts to some abilities to behave similarly toexactly like the 5v5 live version Now for the patch comparing with the 5v5 live version a good chunk of these changes are already known and are equivalent to the December patch but I am still writing them down for better understanding Tank Tank role passive Knockback and critical damage reduction removed No longer grants extra health Ultimate generation reduction reduced from 40 to 20 DVa Base health increased

Does any soldier player actually want bigger bullets What exactly is the target demographic for this change As far as I am aware every soldier player above masters actually cares about getting better at aiming and derives pleasure from improving their aim And any soldier that isnt on console and aspiring to be masters feels the exact same way This was a hotfix change which means that somehow soldiers performance was bad enough after the midseason change surely it wasnt already bad enough post season 9 to get this change before now to warrant it Soldier got hotfix nerfed for having 009 bullet size a week or two after season the season 9 changes but pharah was allowed to be uber op for at least 56 months Soldier still feels like absolute doodoo because no matter how much effort and how much better I am than the other players in my game they can just pick sojourn or torb and pick their boogers and get way too much value from doing that It is literally better to swap off of soldier as someone who has mastered the hero because it takes so much more effort to just enjoy the hero than it is to lock in any other dps and put my feet on my desk This character just doesnt do enough damage to warrant picking him most of the time Consistent dps is completely worthless if you have 0 ability to finish people off by yourself Tracer has 220 dps while soldier has 171 and tracer can easily get herself into positions with minimal downtimeprep unlike soldier where she can easily unload all of that dps with minimal pressure In order to do damage as soldier you have to either pray you can hard flank and get away with it or you have to put yourself in a position where you WILL easily be killed by any other hero in the game You put yourself in this position to do damage and then you get stat checked by MANY different heroes in 1v1s especially after season 9 Most of the soldier players I am aware of care about aiming and doing damage not being forced to play a character where the only thing he can do is perma kite TERRIBLY before he gets his major perk and bait people to look at him Doing that is only realistically possible on some maps unless the enemy team turns their monitor off imagine offense first point temple of anubis you literally cant flank and surprise people and thats how a lot of the maps are designed This bullet size change is spit in our face because it makes the character LESS FUN for us and doesnt actually do anything to make him more viable or playable The bullet size increase isnt going to fix his god awful breakpoints,Does any soldier

Thoughts on indicators for enemies with 90 ult charge I was just thinking of how there is no way to know when enemies have their ultimates besides its been way too long surely they have it by now What if you could tell when an enemy has their ultimate or is really close Use cases You could know when its safe to charge a Mei without her freezing your whole team You could know to not try to finish a critical HP enemy off when Ana is glowing You could stop gambling on whether the enemy Reaper is jumping into the fight out of stupidity or with an ult bomb You could try to separate from your teammates when Tracer is about to throw a bomb A bunch of ultimates give you decently fair warning like Sigmas Wrecking Balls Illaris while other ultimates are nearly instant and in many cases unavoidable to someone playing without expecting one to appear such as Reapers Pharahs Zenyattas Anas besides tiny shifts in playstyle andor positioning you dont know when theyre coming Personally I think it would make the game more skillful and more strategic if you could see when an ultimate is coming because it would be more about taking precautions and less about gambling on if theyre dumbbluffing or about to wipe your team Ultimates that take a while to start like Sigmas could start sooner now that he is shining yellow or whatever the indicator may be and you have warning already Another thing you still wouldnt know if the ultimate is quite ready or not You can have a choice of either going all out and killing them before they fully charge ult or retreating and preparing for the ult Or alternatively what if it was only for 100 charged ults Or what if there were distinguishable indicators for both almost ready and fully ready enemies And what about passives for this One that lets certain heroes see 80 or 85 charged ults If this isnt a feature by default one that distinguishes almost ready and fully ready indication One that gives you bonus ult charge for damagingkilling enemies nearlyfully ready Perks that do similar things Obviously it wouldnt be immediately balanced either The number would change and passivesperks if existing would too shift accordingly over time PS Please be civil in the comments I just want a discussion about this feature that Ive been thinking about recently and that I currently believe would be good for the game Im open to convincing arguments and counterpoints or further agreement,Thoughts on indicators for enemies with 90 ult charge I was just thinking of how there is no way to know when enemies have their

Junkrat perk idea EDIT removed the charge mine idea I was under the impression from the description of the ability that it wouldnt detonate until it was armed They really need to word that better Okay so some heroes have some pretty balanced perks yeah They often fit with the play style and work well depending on the situation However junkrat I believe only has two good perks and thats the aluminum trap and frag cannon leaving the nitro tire and the enhanced concussion mine as undesirable So Im going to suggest a new major and minor perk that might end up being a tad more useful So Id like to ask for feedback and please be honest but also fair Minor perk mayhem tire When the riptire is destroyed It lets out a few of junkrats explosive bocce balls This can be pretty useful to make sure that ripped tires not completely wasted if it gets close enough but its not enough to change the entire flow of the game which is why I think its worthy of a minor perk I do have some other ideas but they might not be nearly as viable like a major perk that increases the projectile speed as well as explosion radius of the frag launcher but all the projectiles only bounce one time Or something like the April fools update where you can have multiple traps at once But that would require changing the aluminum trap and frag Cannon And I feel like those are pretty well balanced anyways After all that said and done I do appreciate the changes made by the perks they do appear to be very useful in certain situations they just dont fit junk rats general play style which is the spam choke points fly around using explosives and obliterate in tight spaces But I would like to know what you guys think if these are good or bad or if there could be a change to either of these that would make it even more useful Again please be honest but respectful,Junkrat perk idea EDIT removed the charge mine idea I was under the impression from the description of the ability that it would nt detonate until it

Some tanks in 6v6 need Zarya Adjustments In the 6v6 mode Zaryas bubbles work like they did in OW1 which means she cant double bubble herself or a teammate This is good because it means Zarya cant hold an aggressive position for a ridiculous amount of time while also having a second tank to absorb even more pressure Double bubble is required for 5v5 solo tanking but would be unfair in 6v6 However some of the other tanks havent been adjusted like this and feel annoying to play against Hazard is a prime suspect He was designed to be a solo tank that has almost constant uptime which dosnt work in 6v6 I suggest his block be made a cooldown like like doomfist or changed completely You dont really need his block so much in 6v6 anyway Roadhogs vape is still on a a resource meter again make it a cooldown like it use to be With a second tank roadhog dosnt need to be constantly on the front line If his vape gets cancels or anti naded you had a second tank to abosorb the pressure while he resets The resource meter just gives him to much uptime I dont think Ramatra should be able to block in 6v6 At least not how it is implemented now He already has a shield allow him to deploy it while in nemesis mode and maybe give it a shorter cooldownthe shield But being able to place a shield and then block damage for 8 seconds is too much in 6v6 Mauga doesnt need a 50 damage mitigation on his charge CC immunity is fine but both is too much With a second tank to help absorb pressure he is fine without it Sigma is a OW1 tank that was a OW2 tank before before it came out He has range damage a shield a matrix and a stun Sure he has no mobility baring perk but this is still a bulky kit for 6v6 I would significantly reduce the shield health or make its cooldown between uses longer Instead of 2 seconds its 3 or 4 I would go with health nerf since that the cooldown nerf might lose some of the fluidity thats makes Sigma satisfying to play I dont want to gut his identity as a main and off tank hybrid but he cant do everything all at once Hammond has been super annoying to play against in 6v6 It is way too hard to kill him Im not to sure how I would change him but maybe getting rid of his base shield health could be a start Maybe replace more of his armor health with base health I think JQ Rein Dva Zarya Doom and Winston are fine,Some tanks in 6v6 need Zarya Adjustments In the 6v6 mode Zaryas bubbles work like they did in OW1 which means she ca nt double bubble herself or a teammate This is good because it means Zarya ca nt hold an aggressive position for a ridiculous amount of time while also having a second tank to absorb even more pressure Double bubble is required for 5v5 solo tanking but would be unfair in 6v6 However some of the other tanks have nt been adjusted like this and feel annoying to play against Hazard is a prime suspect He was designed to be a solo tank that has almost constant uptime which dosnt work in 6v6 I suggest his block be made a cooldown like like doomfist or changed completely You do nt really need his block so much in 6v6 anyway Roadhogs vape is still on a a resource meter again make it a cooldown like it use to be With a second tank roadhog dosnt need to be constantly on the front line If his vape gets cancels or anti naded you had a second tank to abosorb the pressure while he resets The resource meter just gives him to much uptime I do nt think Ramatra should be able to block in 6v6 At least not how it is implemented now He already has a shield allow him to deploy it while in nemesis mode and maybe give it a shorter cooldownthe shield But being able to place a shield and then block damage for 8 seconds is too much in 6v6 Mauga does nt need a 50 damage mitigation on his charge CC immunity is fine but both is too much With a second tank to help absorb pressure he is fine without it Sigma is a OW1 tank that was a OW2 tank before before it came out He has range damage a shield a matrix and a stun Sure he has no mobility baring perk but this is still a bulky kit for 6v6 I would significantly reduce the shield health or make its cooldown between uses longer Instead of 2 seconds its 3 or 4 I would go with

My Issue with perk selection and a possible Solution DISCLAIMER I am not sure if thats already been suggested or if Blizzard addressed this issue In the heat of battle its easy to select the wrong perk even if it doesnt happen often The fastpaced nature of the game demands full attention making it sometimes difficult to doublecheck perk choices Sometimes I misclick or forget whether Ive reached level 2 or 3 leading to incorrect selections While one could argue that perks should and could be chosen while respawning rather than midfight thats not always practical at least for me Some perks like increased projectile launcher speed Rat are highly effective in combat making midbattle selections necessary Even when respawning and rushing back especially in crucial moments like overtime the focus is on reaching the objective not carefully analyzing perk icons Accidentally choosing the wrong perk can completely throw off a players strategy For example selecting a trap perk instead of a nitro boost can drastically change my approach with tire e g not being able to take out a support in a more effective way which can be the difference between securing or losing a team fight or even the game Suggestion for Improvement To reduce misclicks and improve clarity I suggest giving each perk level a distinct color MINOR perks Keep white and black icons MAJOR perks Use red or another distinct color Currently all perk icons look too similar making it difficult to differentiate them in fastpaced situations A clearer visual distinction would help prevent accidental selections allowing players to execute their intended strategy without unnecessary mistakes What do you guys think,My Issue with perk selection and a possible Solution DISCLAIMER I am not sure if that s already

Balance gone As a console player high plat to low diamond this is just my experienceresults may vary After spending a lot of time with the perks and the latest update and waiting through a couple of patches to see how the devs handle things I feel like Overwatch 2 is the least balanced its been since Seasons 56 The only times that felt worse in my opinion were the Uber Queen patch and Maugas initial release Honestly I think this shift might be intentional With the introduction of perks it feels like the devs are moving away from a more balanced competitive experience and leaning into fast highimpact gameplay instead That said this is still the first season with perks so theres obviously time for things to change and improve as the system evolves What do you all think Have you noticed the same trend,Balance gone As a console player high plat to low diamond this is just my experienceresults may vary After spending a lot of time with the perks and the latest update and waiting through a couple of patches to see how the devs handle things I feel like Overwatch 2 is the least balanced its been since Seasons 56 The only times that felt worse in my opinion were the Uber Queen patch and Maugas initial release Honestly I think this shift might be intentional With the introduction of perks it feels like the devs are moving away from a more balanced competitive experience and leaning into fast highimpact gameplay instead That said this is still the first season with perks so there s obviously time for things to change and improve as the system evolves What do you all think Have you noticed the same trend,balance go as a console player high plat to low diamond this be just my experienceresult may vary after spend a lot of time with the perk and the late update and wait through a couple of patch to see how the devs handle thing I feel like Overwatch 2 be the least balanced its be since Seasons 56 the only time that feel bad in my opinion be the Uber Queen patch and Maugas initial release honestly I think this shift might be intentional with the introduction of perk it feel like the devs be move away from a more balanced competitive experience and lean into fast highimpact gameplay instead that say this be still the first season with perk so there s obviously time for thing to change and improve as the system evolve what do you all think have you notice the same trend,balance console player high plat low diamond experienceresult vary spend lot time perk late update wait couple patch devs handle thing feel like Overwatch 2 balanced Seasons 56 time feel bad opinion Uber Queen patch Maugas initial release honestly think shift intentional introduction perk feel like devs away balanced competitive experience lean fast highimpact gameplay instead season perk s obviously time thing change improve system evolve think notice trend

The perks I want for Juno As a Juno main I found the perks pretty boring and often useless Most feedback has been not that negative with some perks generally considered mediocre and some considered bad the latter being buffed I think its important to note that Juno has a lot of mobility but it is meh mobility that allows her to go from A to B faster and minor dodging but can not compare with the get out of jail free card and dodging other heroes get She does not need more halfassed tools to get around # Current perks and why I dont like them Familiar vitals This is a very minor speed up taking into account that your teammates are likely to be closer and thus lockon would be already fast and if they are far the projectile still has to travel to them anyway Hyper boost To get the effect you need to burn two cooldows you probably want to rotate or save ring for a teammate In exchange you get the ability to move back and forth in place in a predictable manner and without fine control Master blaster 50 more of very little is still little Juno is not a fighter and this barely helps her Also to get that 50 damage you need precision with a burst fire gun Reboots This is useful to get height in some maps but as I said before Juno has enough mediocre mobility options The extra duration is not necessary most of the time because you would be rotating your speed boosts # What I would like to see Reboost Glide boost grants one extra dash pressing shift while boosting will let Juno dash again Press a third time to cancel This provides Juno with a bit more dodging that the player can actually control useful mobility Longer blaster Mediblaster falloff range is moved 5 meters away This allows Juno to pressureheal effectively from a few more positions It contrasts with the other perk which offers more survivability in the more aggressive positions needed with shorter range Torpedo efficiency If pulsar torpedoes fires less than 3 torpedoes 1 or 2 cooldown is halved This changes the way torpedoes are used making it worthwhile to use it on fewer targets instead of trying to go for a full spread Pulsar shielding Pulsar torpedoes grants 25 extra health for the duration making it easier to survive while targeting This makes the decision between the major perks much more interesting and encourages slightly different playstyles,The perks I want for Juno As a Juno main I found the perks pretty boring and often useless Most feedback has been not that negative with some perks generally considered mediocre and some considered bad the latter being buffed I think its important to note that Juno has a lot of mobility but it is meh mobility that allows her to go from A to B faster and minor dodging but can not compare with the get out of jail free card and dodging other heroes get She does not need more halfassed tools to get around Current perks and why I do nt like them Familiar vitals This is a very minor speed up taking into account that your teammates are likely to be closer and thus lockon would be already fast and if they are far the projectile still has to travel to them anyway Hyper boost To get the effect you need to burn two cooldows you probably want to rotate or save ring for a teammate In exchange you get the ability to move back and forth in place in a predictable manner and without fine control Master blaster 50 more of very little is still little Juno is not a fighter and this barely helps her Also to get that 50 damage you need precision with a burst fire gun Reboots This is useful to get height in some maps but as I said before Juno has enough mediocre mobility options The extra duration is not necessary most of the time because you would be rotating your speed boosts What I would like to see Reboost Glide boost grants one

Sombra support rework Concept Sombra has been reworked and changed over and over and over again There just seems to be no end to it and no matter what the changes are somebody is always left unhappy With the addition of perks we got the White Hat perk which lets sombra play in a sort of semioffsupport way occasionally clutch healing teammates while still being able to do her job as a DPS Personally i think this way of playing sombra is way WAY more fun probably because im a support main and so i came up with this rework that leans into that offsupport way of playing with her focusing much less on high sustained healing output and more on short and infrequent bursts of healing and actually supporting her teammates through buffs and setups while trying to partially make up for that lack of personal healing by helping the other support do their job easier by being decent at peeling and also helping them to target their healing Please read and i hope you enjoy # Sombra Support

Overwatch 2 counter culture Why has counter culture gotten so bad in ow2 I am a tank player with 1000 hours on this game and I usually play casual qp with my friends What is wrong with this games counter culture that has the enemy team instantly counter swapping on their first death I dont even have to be a problem for me to be met with a hard counter when they respawn I have ZERO problems with counter swapping counter swapping is much better than being stomped one sidedly But I am sick and tired of being insta countered 9 in 10 games that I play just for queuing tank and the people who try to defend this insta counter play style even when I try to mirror especially in qp And fed up with YouTubers and TikTok creators telling people to play this counter against this tank to always win As it stands I think the counters were way less prevalent compared to the start ow2 And I think this is a really big reason why and likely also the reason why the metal ranks felt the most terrible to climb out of out of all ranks as the majority of these players usually stay below diamond and masters The perks help but it is rarely useful against the counters that just go completely over them and just now I went 30ish games where I had 5 games that I wasnt Insta countered and only two of them where I wasnt countered at all It was manageable during the early seasons as I could just play qp to escape the counters but Im finding lots of these players even there And I dont like playing better as it just results in more counters And sweatier games for people trying to play in a casual setting So I ask again why why has counter culture gotten so bad to stoop to where it is now in ow2,Overwatch 2 counter culture Why has counter culture gotten so bad in ow2 I am a tank player with 1000 hours

Not happy about stadium mode Looks like cobbled PVE content in the role 5v5 format if the devs wanted to release a mode that was full on MOBA with lanes bases jungles side objectives and minions I

long 2 5v5 players like to shoot their way out of everything on hitscan they wont like playing a team builder with shop items and kit bloat 3 6v6 players wont play 5v5 they have their own gamemode now 4 Theres no switching heroes during the match so if you roll out on a certain pick and the enemy team has your counters youre out of luck until the items are buyable 5 Only 14 heroes are out on launch

its lowest points when chasing other games trends role queue ruined overwatch 1 5v5 ruined overwatch 2 and stadium will certainly be a massive misstep as time goes on Update I just looked it up on

With it having been over a month since they were released how do you feel about perks and their implementation Personally Ive really enjoyed the extra nuance that choosing your perks brings as well as the incentive they give you to stay on one character and not counterswap I will say however that my enjoyment of the former hinges on both perk options being equal and in cases where one perk is significantly better than the other it feels like the perk system falters What do you think,With it having been over a month since they were released how do you feel about perks and their implementation Personally I ve really enjoyed the extra nuance that choosing your perks brings as well as the incentive they give you to stay on one character and not counterswap I will say however that my enjoyment of the former hinges on both perk options being equal and in cases where one perk is significantly better than the other it feels like the perk system falters What do you think,with it having be over a month since they be release how do you feel about perk and their implementation personally I ve really enjoy the extra nuance that choose your perk bring as well as the incentive they give you to stay on one character and not counterswap I will say however that my enjoyment of the former hinge on both perk option be equal and in case where one perk be significantly well than the other it feel like the perk system falter what do you think,having month release feel perk implementation personally ve enjoy extra nuance choose perk bring incentive stay character counterswap enjoyment hinge perk option equal case perk significantly feel like perk system falter think

Two thoughtssuggestions with no particular correlation 1 there should be an addition set of perks that are role perks and every character of that role can have access to them if they feel like they might be situationally more useful than either of the characterspecific perks IIRC something like this was in a test patch about a year ago before perks rolled out 2 there should be weeklydaily challenges that tell players to use their pings and their mouse wheel commands,Two thoughtssuggestions with no particular correlation 1 there should be an addition set of perks that are role perks and every character of that role can have access to them if they feel like they might be situationally more useful than either of the characterspecific perks IIRC something like this was in a test patch about a year ago before perks rolled out 2 there should be weeklydaily challenges that tell players to use their pings and their mouse wheel commands,two thoughtssuggestion with no particular correlation 1 there should be an addition set of perk that be role perk and every character of that role can have access to they if they feel like they might be situationally more useful than either of the characterspecific perk iirc something like this be in a test patch about a year ago before perk roll out 2 there should be weeklydaily challenge that tell player to use their ping and their mouse wheel command,thoughtssuggestion particular correlation 1 addition set perk role perk character role access feel like situationally useful characterspecific perk iirc like test patch year ago perk roll 2 weeklydaily challenge tell player use ping mouse wheel command

friendly reminder that after getting your minor perk you should rethink your tracer pathing and that you can eat healthpacks while at full hp there are many maps in which this perk is a godsend for moving around particularly out of spawn yet i almost never see people using the perk outside of combat lets use an example blizzard world 2nd defenders spawn you can blink to the health pack right outside spawn and then to the one on coast massively decreasing the time you need to move past the spinning thing,friendly reminder that after getting your minor perk you should rethink your tracer pathing and that you can eat healthpacks while at full hp there are many maps in which this perk is a godsend for moving around particularly out of spawn yet i almost never see people using the perk outside of combat lets use an example blizzard world 2nd defenders spawn you can blink to the health pack right outside spawn and then to the one on coast massively decreasing the time you need to move past the spinning thing,friendly reminder that after get your minor perk you should rethink your tracer pathing and that you can eat healthpack while at full hp there be many map in which this perk be a godsend for move around particularly out of spawn yet I almost never see people use the perk outside of combat let use an example blizzard world 2nd defender spawn you can blink to the health pack right outside spawn and then to the one on coast massively decrease the time you need to move past the spin thing,friendly reminder minor perk rethink tracer pathing eat healthpack hp map perk godsend particularly spawn people use perk outside combat let use example blizzard world 2nd defender spawn blink health pack right outside spawn coast massively decrease time need past spin thing

My honest take on Venture A bit of context Ive been a Venture main aince her release trying to climb the ranks as a Venture OTP One Trick Player It doesnt work out that much so Ive been resorting to Soj when Im clearly outmatched Mind you I started my journey mid Bronze jumping between Bronze 2 and 3 and steadily climbing to whre I am now wich is low to mid Plat around 60 to 80 Plat 4 So heres my opinion she is outclassed everywhere by othere characters As a dive hero she as a lot of potential The combination of Burrow and Drill Dash as abilities makes it so she can go pretty much anywhere and get out as soon as things get a little bit heated or thats what you would think Lets be honest here Burrow as an escape tool is bad Unlike other Oh sh buttons like Reapers Wraith Form or Tracers Recall there is a windup time and GOD DOES IT LAST LONG Between the moment the button is clicked and the moment you are safe underground around a second as passed and god know how easy it is to be canceled Hook hinder stun even hack So in order to be safe even after its been canceled you need to be starting it even before the fight as started and we all know thats just not possible Next Drill Dash How to say this Simply put its actually not bad From my personal experience it is one of if not the most versatile ability in the game It does good damage has a good range and moves ennemies Overall it is a really well balanced tool with only an 8 second cooldown The only issue I have with it is its lack of CC Crowd Control AKA stuns and sh Dont get me wrong I am not saying Give that thing the ability to cancel everything with 8 seconds of down time but at least make it so that ennemies in the drill cant attack cause right now I could get hindered while drilling him and no one wants that Following that her overall state is weird I would want to talk about skins but Yeah 3 skins is all we have 1 epic from drops and 2 legendaries 1 from shops and 1 from battlepass THATS EVERYTHING Even Freja who isnt even out yet has more skin concepts then Venture as official skins Then again I really feel like Blizzard just doesnt want to admit she exists Finally her pick opportunity As a Venture main I feel like she can work in any comp and situation She has the range for poke the AOE for brawl and the mobility for divs The issue is that she isnt that good in any one of them She doesnt have that big of a range even with her perk she has not that much HP so dies quickly and doesnt have a big burst damage She is easily outclassed by other characters like Sojourn Mei or Tracer in those situations And dont get me strated on counters She cant kill tanks any flying characters are out of reach characters with oh sh buttons are just not a viable option CC characters are out of the equation and Im probably missing something So what is there left Only a handful of heros Ana Lifeweaver Bapif you have a good team Ash Widow Hanzo Bastion but thats it So yeah Thank you

What is on your Overwatch wishlist Besides getting everything for free what would you like to see for the future of Overwatch It could be reasonable things or completely unrealistic After the rollout of changes such as perks and playing the April Fools Normalwatch mode I was thinking about all the fun things Blizzard could explore Examples Queue for specific mapsmodes More ingame character interaction such as Lifeweavers pull or Hanzo riding Orisa Keep bringing the winnable loot boxes,What is on your Overwatch wishlist Besides getting everything for free what would you like to see for the future of Overwatch It could be reasonable things or completely unrealistic After the rollout of changes such as perks and playing the April Fools Normalwatch mode I was thinking about all the fun things Blizzard could explore Examples Queue for specific mapsmodes More ingame character interaction such as Lifeweavers pull or Hanzo riding Orisa Keep bringing the winnable loot boxes,what be on your overwatch wishlist besides get everything for free what would you like to see for the future of Overwatch it could be reasonable thing or completely unrealistic after the rollout of change such as perk and play the April Fools Normalwatch mode I be think about all the fun thing Blizzard could explore Examples Queue for specific mapsmode More ingame character interaction such as lifeweaver pull or Hanzo ride Orisa keep bring the winnable loot box,overwatch wishlist free like future Overwatch reasonable thing completely unrealistic rollout change perk play April Fools Normalwatch mode think fun thing Blizzard explore Examples Queue specific mapsmode ingame character interaction lifeweaver pull Hanzo ride Orisa bring winnable loot box
IMO Ability Replacement perks should just add new abilities not replace existing ones I believe perks have overall been a great addition to Overwatch revitalizing the game and bringing much needed variation and unpredictability to matches However my biggest complaint with perks is the fact that it feels like the power level of the perks was not distributed equally This can be seen most evidently in replacement perks such as Bastions tank form or Orisas shield Rather than being actual perks as in additional upsides they feel more like excuses to give players the chance to reuse old abilities That sentiment by itself is actually a great idea for a perk but it comes at the cost of one of the heros existing abilities Bastions turret form is replaced with tank form removing his high dps hitscan options and making him struggle against flying heroes more and Orisas javelin spin is replaced with her shield removing her only mobility option and an incredibly useful matrix utility These heroes dont gain any upsides they replace their current utility with different utility This makes their usefulness situational instead of always beneficial and in some cases choosing the wrong perk can be a straight up nerf Contrast this with perks like Anas Every single one of Anas perks is a straight upgrade Her self nano perk literally gives her two ultimates for the price of one There is no situation where any one of Anas perks would only be situationally useful Her utility is not replaced in any way the only choice she makes is the choice between what buff she wants While the value of each perk does vary between situations meaning some will be more beneficial in one instance than another she is never nerfed compared to her previous state for choosing the wrong perk This comes down to a matter of opinion Maybe you prefer the limitations of Bastions and Orisas perk and think Ana is the outlier who needs to be nerfed Personally I would rather see heros get buffed and instead just let heroes like Bastion and Orisa get their new abilities ontop of their existing kits While the balance of perks certainly highlights the favoritism towards some heroes like Ana those balance decisions do get results There is a reason Ana is the most played hero in the game being able to do straight up more ontop of what you could already do is fun One of the perks biggest design philosophies was to not focus as much on balance but more on fun I think it is more fun to give players more rather than take something away in return,IMO Ability Replacement perks should just add new

Whats an interesting perk fact that youve learnt Whether it be in the midst of battle or just messing around Something that isnt immediately obvious or explained in the hero menu A popular example being Tracers octuple blink For me I learned that if you pick Illaris captive sun perk mid ult the perk actually extends her flight time AS SHES FLYING so you can have 2 seconds left on the clock pick the perk and then itll extend the time up to 5 seconds Im thinking this might provide a reason then for holding off picking the pylon perk immediately if you find you need the extra flight time to escape or zone an area,What s an interesting perk fact that you ve learnt Whether it be in the midst of battle or just messing around Something that is nt immediately obvious or explained in the hero menu A popular example being Tracers octuple blink For me I learned that if you pick Illaris captive sun perk mid ult the perk actually extends her flight time AS SHES FLYING so you can have 2 seconds left on the clock pick the perk and then it ll extend the time up to 5 seconds I m thinking this might provide a reason then for holding off picking the pylon perk immediately if you find you need the extra flight time to escape or zone an area,what s an interesting perk fact that you ve learn whether it be in the midst of battle or just mess around something that be not immediately obvious or explain in the hero menu a popular example be tracer octuple blink for I I learn that if you pick Illaris captive sun perk mid ult the perk actually extend her flight time as SHES fly so you can have 2 second leave on the clock pick the perk and then it ll extend the time up to 5 second I m think this might provide a reason then for hold off pick the pylon perk immediately if you find you need the extra flight time to escape or zone an area,s interesting perk fact ve learn midst battle mess immediately obvious explain hero menu popular example tracer octuple blink learn pick Illaris captive sun perk mid ult perk actually extend flight time SHES fly 2 second leave clock pick perk ll extend time 5 second m think provide reason hold pick pylon perk immediately find need extra flight time escape zone area

I miss Freja I dont think Ive ever vibed with a character as much as I do with Freja Ive been a big Ashe and Cass player for awhile now but Freja just scratches some itch that those characters dont Take Aim is a literal firework of dopamine every damn time I score a critical hit with it Something about jumping into the air dashing into the enemy sightlines popping some support in the skull dashing back into cover and seeing the elimination icon seconds later gives this You are already dead type of feeling Its so fun Its literally so fun that she gets this Widowmaker syndrome of never using her primary fire since her secondary is just beyond satisfying Not to mention how good Take Aim is at removing armour making her a solid pick for countering certain tanks if you can get the dash down I think one of my favourite parts about her is that shes a glass cannon She does an intense amount of dps in the right hands but her float in the air when ADS ability makes it so that any good hitscan hero and snipe her fairly quickly while shes airborne She rewards new players with a lot of dps but will just as quickly punish them if they dont grasp her weaknesses Usually when a new OW character comes out I have this period of thinking Yeah Thisll be my hero before finding out their weakpoints and going back to my comfort picks But Freja is different I think Ive played a single match of Overwatch since Frejas playtest ended and I really dont want to go back until she gets here High mobility high skill ceiling rewarding gameplay wellbalanced In my eyes at least and solid

corner and the future is looking super bright Perks Obviously this was no pun intended a game changer Perks have kept me and many others hooked for much longer than I thought they completely change the approach to games whilst still keeping that core experience Whoever came up with the idea deserves a raise New heroes Hazard in particular was a big success and proved that the devs CAN continue to make fun balanced tanks in 5v5 Freja looks to be nothing groundbreaking but still fun with a good design Changes to Lifeweaver and Mauga have also been really good and made them a lot less frustrating Stadium I thought stadium was going to be a gimmicky side show to the main modes of OW Seeing that trailer made me realise just how fleshed out it is A tournament like mode with skill trees ranks unique abilities etc sounds incredibly fun and I cant wait til it releases in a week 6v6 A big issue for a long time Extending the 6v6 Open Queue to all of next season is perfect think it should remain permanent People now have a choice of 5v5 or 6v6 depending on their preference I think thats fantastic Loot boxes A fantastic and consumer friendly way to keep people playing Its a shame theyll be reducing the amount hopefully not by the number being rumoured but getting anything for free is still nice Balance Say what you will about balance I know I have my opinions cough cough why is Sojourn STILL hard meta but at the very least they are willing to do hot fix patches on a whim even for the april fools event I think that element can be praised whilst still having reservations about some other decisions All in all I think it goes without saying that the devs have really been hitting it out of the park recently People calling them lazy is just plain wrong There are OF COURSE still issues with OW and there always will be but the decisions of Aaron and the team have lead the game to a healthy state of growth and competition I think that deserves praise,Overwatch Devs have

Brigitte and Lucios Normalwatch changes should be incorporated into their regular kits as perks I mean Shield Throw is a skillshot and people always complain about Brigitte being a no skill hero so I think that should make everyone happy right As for Lucio IDK I just think its really fun and Lucio mains deserve to have some nice things with how few good skins and lore updates hes received XD I feel like maybe it would also apply to Zenyatta And Lifeweaver too What other heroes do you people think should keep their normalwatch changes permamently,Brigitte and Lucios Normalwatch changes should be incorporated into their regular kits as perks I mean Shield Throw is a skillshot and people always complain about Brigitte being a no skill hero so I think that should make everyone happy right As for Lucio IDK I just think its really fun and Lucio mains deserve to have some nice things with how few good skins and lore updates he s received XD I feel like maybe it would also apply to Zenyatta And Lifeweaver too What other heroes do you people think should keep their normalwatch changes permamently,Brigitte and Lucios Normalwatch change should be incorporate into their regular kit as perk I mean Shield Throw be a skillshot and people always complain about Brigitte be a no skill hero so I think that should make everyone happy right as for Lucio IDK I just think its really fun and Lucio main deserve to have some nice thing with how few good skin and lore update he s receive XD I feel like maybe it would also apply to Zenyatta and Lifeweaver too what other hero do you people think should keep their normalwatch change permamently,Brigitte Lucios Normalwatch change incorporate regular kit perk mean Shield Throw skillshot people complain Brigitte skill hero think happy right Lucio IDK think fun Lucio main deserve nice thing good skin lore update s receive XD feel like maybe apply Zenyatta Lifeweaver hero people think normalwatch change permamently

Marvel Rivals made me get back into Overwatch I recently tried playing Marvel Rivals because of the hype around it I thought the game was unpolished unbalanced and the hero abilities just werent as well designed and syngerestic as the abilities from Overwatch The whole game wasnt as well designed as Overwatch You can say its new but that doesnt matter New or old I dont want to play a worse game The perceived shortcomings I saw in Marvel Rivals made me crave Overwatch I havent played Overwatch in years really just briefly when 2 came out I tried playing OW again and Ive been having a blast Perks saved this game They may seem like a small change to some but I think its a spectacular addition The decision making and choices every game is an excellent dynamic I like that it somewhat discourages swapping too When 2 came out I played it briefly and didnt like the 1 tank raid boss more than 2 tank but I realized its been fixed now and 1 tank is better than 2 1 tank means less shields and more playmaking ability which means more fun Well done Blizzard Keep it up,Marvel Rivals made me get back into Overwatch I recently tried playing Marvel Rivals because of the hype around it I thought the game was unpolished unbalanced and the hero abilities just were nt as well designed and syngerestic as the abilities from Overwatch The whole game was nt as well designed as Overwatch You can say its new but that does nt matter New or old I do nt want to play a worse game The perceived shortcomings I saw in Marvel Rivals made me crave Overwatch I have nt played Overwatch in years really just briefly when 2 came out I tried playing OW again and I ve been having a blast Perks saved this game They may seem like a small change to some but I think its a spectacular addition The decision making and choices every game is an excellent dynamic I like that it somewhat discourages swapping too When 2 came out I played it briefly and did nt like the 1 tank raid boss more than 2 tank but I realized its been fixed now and 1 tank is better than 2 1 tank means less shields and more playmaking ability which means more fun Well done Blizzard Keep it up,Marvel Rivals make I get back into Overwatch I recently try play Marvel Rivals because of the hype around it I think the game be unpolishe unbalanced and the hero ability just be not as well design and syngerestic as the ability from Overwatch the whole game be not as well design as Overwatch you can say its new but that do not matter New or old I do not want to play a bad game the perceive shortcoming I see in Marvel Rivals make I crave Overwatch I have not play Overwatch in year really just briefly when 2 come out I try play OW again and I ve be have a blast Perks save this game they may seem like a small change to some but I think its a spectacular addition the decision making and choice every game be an excellent dynamic I like that it somewhat discourage swap too when 2 come out I play it briefly and do not like the 1 tank raid boss more than 2 tank but I realize its be fix now and 1 tank be well than 2 1 tank mean less shield and more playmaking ability which mean more fun well do Blizzard keep it up,Marvel Rivals Overwatch recently try play Marvel Rivals hype think game unpolishe unbalanced hero ability design syngerestic ability Overwatch game design Overwatch new matter New old want play bad game perceive shortcoming Marvel Rivals crave Overwatch play Overwatch year briefly 2 come try play OW ve blast Perks save game like small change think spectacular addition decision making choice game excellent dynamic like somewhat discourage swap 2 come play briefly like 1 tank raid boss 2 tank realize fix 1 tank 2 1 tank mean shield playmaking ability mean fun Blizzard
Do we really need hero bans Ever since Blizz announced were getting hero bans the discussion seems to revolve around which heroes will never see the light of day again in comp The the top 2 reasons most people use rightfully for which heroes theyll ban the most are 1 they make the whole lobby miserable and 2 they make playing their hero miserable My thing is arent those two things that we should solve through balance patches Weve heard by now the endless complains of how horrible it feels to play tank into Ana support into Sombra anything into Widow and the sentiment the community seems to have around these heroes is ban them until Blizzard has no choice but to rework them So then why do we need to do all that before potential reworks happen Just get to it now Im sure Zarya will sit pretty in DVa players ban lists and so will Torb in Tracer players lists but instead of entirely removing a hero counter from the hero pool why dont we work in softening hard counters Tough to do through balance patches alone without overcomplicating things but since we have perks now isnt that the perfect opportunity to add more options for heroes to deal with their counters better Were already seeing some stuff like Ashes minor perks giving her ways to deal with divers and flankers better or one of Dooms major perks allowing him to absorb projectiles including sleep darts for example so theres potential for more there On top of it with certain heroes potentially rarely being seen what will happen is metas will shift from game to game What do we do about Mauga when Ana isnt an option Guess we now balance Mauga around the fact that Ana is banned most of the time What if Ana gets through but Kiri got the ban hammer this game so you have no choice but to eat nades until youre sick of it As an Echo player I will see less of some heroes Im not huge on playing against like Sombra Widow or Zarya because theyre probable top bans most games Thats an indirect buff to a character that has potential to really annoy people if theyre not getting checked Point is even if the most annoying characters in the game will be banned often theres room for others to take their place as a result of this system Then theres the malicious banning aspect If I hate playing with Ball players because I just want a meaty tank with a meaty shield in front of me evey game and not the backline terrorist hamster whats stopping me from banning the character just because of that One of the most overhated heroes Mercy will only get banned because people dislike having Mercy players in their team thats it Well youre not banning the Mercy player youre just banning their best hero A lot of Mercy players just like Doom Ball Lucio etc are onetricks so if their characters are banned it will be a long day for everyone Just dont onetrick idiot Problem solved There are plenty of people making it to the high ends of the ladder on one character alone and thats what they enjoy the most anyway How many games in a row of not getting to play their main will Sombra players be able to take until they decide comp or Overwatch isnt for them anymore Do we really need more disgruntled players Theres good that can come from hero bans Some people will have more fun on average even if others will suffer for it but theres potential for more variety in the game more niche heroes getting their turn and thats nice But maybe theres other ways to get there without introducing even more reasons for people to fight over how Overwatch should and shouldnt be Im all for change when it moves the game forward and innovates it but a hero ban system feels more like chipping away at a core aspect of Overwatch counterpicking at best and creating way bigger headaches down the line at worst So anyway Im banning Zarya every game starting next season D,Do we really need hero bans Ever since Blizz announced were getting hero bans the discussion seems to revolve around which heroes will never

Violet birthday stream translation by ginkam0329 Following the official announcement of his contract termination with ZETA Division Viol2t shared the following on his personal stream The happiest time in my pro career was during my 2019 days with the SF Shock he recalled It was my first shot at the OWL and with great results it left me with nothing but good memories But I think Ill miss 2024 and 2025 the most playing offline matches in OWCS Korea and meeting so many fans I dont think Ill get that kind of experience again 1 On his appearance People often say I look sleepy 2 On his role I dont consider myself a main support I play every support hero Im just a support player period 3 On becoming a pro Ive loved games since I was born and always dreamed of going pro In high school I chose a vocational school to study baking and pastry mainly because unlike regular schools it didnt have mandatory night study I needed that time to play games In the past most general high schools in South Korea required students to stay late for mandatory evening selfstudy sessions often until 10 PM Vocational schools by contrast generally had more flexible schedules 4 Prematch routine I always go to the bathroom and drink coffee gotta feel light and sharp 5 On switching roles If I had to switch roles Id want to be a tank Tanks are extremely impactful in Overwatch 2 and I want to be remembered as a player who played every role on stage 6 Widowmaker moment During Stage 2 of OWL 2019 against Hangzhou Spark I asked my teammates if I could play Widowmaker They said go for it I was nervous but the shots landed thank god 7 Funny memory Back at the 2019 SF Shock team house ChoiHyoBin once cooked ramen late at night and left the windows wide open A rat got in and our manager Thugnasty scolded him

Thoughts From a Returning Player Hello Ive played a bit off and on over the years but the times I played overwatch most seriously so more than dabbling for like a week was back on launch in 2016 later in 2017 where I achieved grandmaster back in a very different era and then later during the launch of overwatch 2 I played a bit around the release of lifeweaver as well but dont really remember what that was like I wanted to share some thoughts on the way the game has changed since then First Perks are a good addition to the game I dont need to elaborate on this as it has been said before Second I do not like 6v6 as much as 5v5 Might be a surprising take given content creators seem to prefer 6v6 but I feel my individual impact is way lower in this mode and my decisions less important What might be more surprising is Im a tank player and still hold this opinion It may change with time but every time I go into 6v6 I come out feeling substantially dumber than I went in Third Clash gamemode was removed from comp for good reasons clearly I do not like this mode at all Thoughts on new heroes Juno For the longest time I wasnt even sure what this hero actually did and just treated it as a free kill In fact my first experience was killing her and wondering who I just killed because I had no knowledge of her existence prior After playing all season shes nice to have on my team nor do I hate her on the enemy team I do not like her ultimate and think the game needs less Giant healingdamage AoE Venture I love having this hero on my team truly the people who play this hero are willing to join me in going deep into the enemy lines and its a joy to be able to see a hero lock in that I know isnt gonna be a pansy who stands behind the choke and gets upset if the game moves fast Hazard Hard to play but inoffensive He seems like a strong generalist dive tank I cant understand what he is saying so the accent is accurate I think the game is in a great spot save for arcade which feels de emphasized by the player base I can no longer grind deathmatch to practice duels because the full lobbies just do not last for more than a few minutes and I immediately crush them Deathmatch was actually my favorite mode so its sad to see where things are I am excited for hero bans and await sending Brig and Ana to the shadow realm when possible I think the overall balance is okay but I dislike some of the support denial abilities which I find antifun See you guys out there next season as for once Ill be sticking around as I attempt to reclaim my ranked glory,Thoughts From a

can we agree 6v6 hog with his 5v5 kit is stupid and unfun on both teams like dude cannot get punished for any mistakes he makes and either doesnt do very much or is basically a widow on tank also the perk where you are able to heal your teammates on no cooldown with your breather is just the dumbest thing i could ever imagine,can we agree 6v6 hog with his 5v5 kit is stupid and unfun on both teams like dude can not get punished for any mistakes he makes and either does nt do very much or is basically a widow on tank also the perk where you are able to heal your teammates on no cooldown with your breather is just the dumbest thing i could ever imagine,can we agree 6v6 hog with his 5v5 kit be stupid and unfun on both team like dude can not get punish for any mistake he make and either do not do very much or be basically a widow on tank also the perk where you be able to heal your teammate on no cooldown with your breather be just the dumb thing I could ever imagine,agree 6v6 hog 5v5 kit stupid unfun team like dude punish mistake basically widow tank perk able heal teammate cooldown breather dumb thing imagine

Bastions Armored Artillery perk should give Armor instead of temporary Overhealth Let me elaborate Currently this perk gives you 300 overhealth that quickly decays after 3 seconds This perk is useful only for one or two things To save yourself by Ulting if youre about to die I think this is a pretty limited usecase which is not very interesting This perk should be reworked into giving Armor that doesnt decay over time It can still be chipped away by taking damage and DOES NOT replenish When your armor is gone you cant get it back unless ulting again I think this would allow Bastion to become a temporary Tank After ulting which puts pressure on your enemies you can pressure them even more by then going into Assault mode with a whopping 600 HP total And this still allows you to save yourself if youre in a pinch Is this overpowered Maybe I just think that right now this perk is very boring and this would add more depth to his playstyle,Bastions Armored Artillery perk should give Armor instead of temporary Overhealth Let me elaborate Currently this perk gives you 300 overhealth that quickly decays after 3 seconds This perk is useful only for one or two things To save yourself by Ulting if you re about to die I think this is a pretty limited usecase which is not very interesting This perk should be reworked into giving Armor that does nt decay over time It can still be chipped away by taking damage and DOES NOT replenish When your armor is gone you ca nt get it back unless ulting again I think this would allow Bastion to become a temporary Tank After ulting which puts pressure on your enemies you can pressure them even more by then going into Assault mode with a whopping 600 HP total And this still allows you to save yourself if you re in a pinch Is this overpowered Maybe I just think that right now this perk is very boring and this would add more depth to his playstyle,Bastions Armored Artillery perk should give Armor instead of temporary Overhealth let I elaborate currently this perk give you 300 overhealth that quickly decay after 3 second this perk be useful only for one or two thing to save yourself by Ulting if you re about to die I think this be a pretty limited usecase which be not very interesting this perk should be rework into give Armor that do not decay over time it can still be chip away by take damage and do not replenish when your armor be go you can not get it back unless ulte again I think this would allow Bastion to become a temporary Tank after ulte which put pressure on your enemy you can pressure they even more by then go into Assault mode with a whopping 600 HP total and this still allow you to save yourself if you re in a pinch be this overpowered maybe I just think that right now this perk be very boring and this would add more depth to his playstyle,Bastions Armored Artillery perk Armor instead temporary Overhealth let elaborate currently perk 300 overhealth quickly decay 3 second perk useful thing save Ulting die think pretty limited usecase interesting perk rework Armor decay time chip away damage replenish armor ulte think allow Bastion temporary Tank ulte pressure enemy pressure Assault mode whopping 600 HP total allow save pinch overpowered maybe think right perk boring add depth playstyle

Is Competitive Overwatch 2 Worth Playing Hi everyone Ive been playing Quick Play for a long time but recently Ive been curious about Competitive mode I tried it back in Overwatch 1 on my old PC and the experience was mixed fun at times but also pretty toxic Plus my hardware limitations forced me to stick mostly to support heroes Now I have a better rig and can play any role but Im still hesitant to jump into Competitive even though a lot has changed Should I give it another shot And is Competitive even worth playing in general,Is Competitive Overwatch 2 Worth Playing Hi everyone I ve been playing Quick Play for a long time but recently I ve been curious about Competitive mode I tried it back in Overwatch 1 on my old PC and the experience was mixed fun at times but also pretty toxic Plus my hardware limitations forced me to stick mostly to support heroes Now I have a better rig and can play any role but I m still hesitant to jump into Competitive even though a lot has changed Should I give it another shot And is Competitive even worth playing in general,be competitive Overwatch 2 Worth play hi everyone I ve be play Quick play for a long time but recently I ve be curious about competitive mode I try it back in Overwatch 1 on my old pc and the experience be mixed fun at time but also pretty toxic plus my hardware limitation force I to stick mostly to support hero now I have a well rig and can play any role but I m still hesitant to jump into Competitive even though a lot have change should I give it another shot and be competitive even worth play in general,competitive Overwatch 2 Worth play hi ve play Quick play long time recently ve curious competitive mode try Overwatch 1 old pc experience mixed fun time pretty toxic plus hardware limitation force stick support hero rig play role m hesitant jump Competitive lot change shot competitive worth play general
im too dumb for this game now I found the overwatch 1 days so simple and easy to dip into each hero had their own playstyle and moves there was a progression bar to level up and that felt like basically it I do not understand anything of the absolute information overload that Overwatch 2 gives me on launch any more how to even acquire skins and now this perk system I just want a multiplayer FPS that i can hop onto after a long day at work and now i feel like i need a 1 hour video essay to explain all the new menus systems and levelling to me im tired boss,i m too dumb for this game now I found the overwatch 1 days so simple and easy to dip into each hero had their own playstyle and moves there was a progression bar to level up and that felt like basically it I do not understand anything of the absolute information overload that Overwatch 2 gives me on launch any more how to even acquire skins and now this perk system I just want a multiplayer FPS that i can hop onto after a long day at work and now i feel like i need a 1 hour video essay to explain all the new menus systems and levelling to me i m tired boss,I m too dumb for this game now I find the overwatch 1 day so simple and easy to dip into each hero have their own playstyle and move there be a progression bar to level up and that feel like basically it I do not understand anything of the absolute information overload that Overwatch 2 give I on launch any more how to even acquire skin and now this perk system I just want a multiplayer fp that I can hop onto after a long day at work and now I feel like I need a 1 hour video essay to explain all the new menus system and levelling to I I m tired boss,m dumb game find overwatch 1 day simple easy dip hero playstyle progression bar level feel like basically understand absolute information overload Overwatch 2 launch acquire skin perk system want multiplayer fp hop long day work feel like need 1 hour video essay explain new menus system levelling m tired boss
Returning to a match after a DC completely resets your progress Ive noticed an issue thats been around for a while and I feel like it deserves some attention When a player disconnects midmatch and manages to rejoin all progress is wiped Ult charge resets to 0 personal stats disappear and with the new Perks system those are gone too and have to earn from the ground up You have to earn everything again from scratch as if you just loaded into a fresh match Its especially rough in ranked games where every bit of progress matters And in most cases the disconnect isnt even the players fault it could be a minor internet hiccup or a crash To make things worse rejoining often comes with a noticeable FPS drop which makes finishing the match frustrating and difficult to play properly It would be great to see Blizzard address this Even something simple like retaining ult charge or previously earned perks would make a big difference,Returning to a match after a DC completely resets your progress I ve noticed an issue that s been around for a while and I feel like it deserves some attention When a player disconnects midmatch and manages to rejoin all progress is wiped Ult charge resets to 0 personal stats disappear and with the new Perks system those are gone too and have to earn from the ground up You have to earn everything again from scratch as if you just loaded into a fresh match Its especially rough in ranked games where every bit of progress matters And in most cases the disconnect is nt even the players fault it could be a minor internet hiccup or a crash To make things worse rejoining often comes with a noticeable FPS drop which makes finishing the match frustrating and difficult to play properly It would be great to see Blizzard address this Even something simple like retaining ult charge or previously earned perks would make a big difference,return to a match after a DC completely reset your progress I ve notice an issue that s be around for a while and I feel like it deserve some attention when a player disconnect midmatch and manage to rejoin all progress be wipe Ult charge reset to 0 personal stat disappear and with the new Perks system those be go too and have to earn from the ground up you have to earn everything again from scratch as if you just load into a fresh match its especially rough in rank game where every bit of progress matter and in most case the disconnect be not even the player fault it could be a minor internet hiccup or a crash to make thing bad rejoin often come with a noticeable FPS drop which make finish the match frustrating and difficult to play properly it would be great to see Blizzard address this even something simple like retain ult charge or previously earn perk would make a big difference,return match DC completely reset progress ve notice issue s feel like deserve attention player disconnect midmatch manage rejoin progress wipe Ult charge reset 0 personal stat disappear new Perks system earn ground earn scratch load fresh match especially rough rank game bit progress matter case disconnect player fault minor internet hiccup crash thing bad rejoin come noticeable FPS drop finish match frustrating difficult play properly great Blizzard address simple like retain ult charge previously earn perk big difference

There is no I in Team but there are four Is in Individualized Ladder Why Overwatch ranking feels strange and what other sports have known for a long time Everyone puts so much emphasis on this being a team game I agree with that but if you look at the top 500 you will see a list of individual players This would make sense in a game that is based off of 1v1s If Overwatch is truly a team game there would be a ladder of Teams not Individuals Look at the ladder of any team sport and any 1v1 sport and you will see what I mean Could you imagine if Soccer was ranked individually like Overwatch This type of system breeds toxicity Blizzard needs a BOTH an Individual and Team Ladder system much like how they did it in StarCraft 2 to be a competitive game I think this is the source of a lot of issues in the current ranking system In order for individual ranking to make sense Blizzard would need to award individual ladder points to players every game weighted by performance Yes this is a complex team game Yes there is more to this game than just the damageheals on the scoreboard there is intricate teamwork involved But the current ladder is not about a team its about one person you Example A high Plat level player and a Silver level player only DuoQ They ONLY play together all the time everytime The game will rank them both at Gold If individual stats were taken into account these players would eventually diverge in rank even if they played together all the time and that is what we SHOULD be seeing But that does not happen,There is no I in Team but there are four Is in

Stadium Interview with Aaron Keller and Dylan Snyder Stadium Mode Insights Development began in 2022 before OW2 launched The original pitch came from Aarons son who prototyped an upgradable roundbased mode called The Tower Its been in development for years not a lastminute idea due to Rivals Hero additions are coming every season No exact count per season yet but they teased more than one is likely Stretch goal Add all heroes eventually but some like Tracer are harder to adapt due to lack of synergy with APUP systems New maps each season converted and brandnew ones Maps are considered just as important as heroes right now Custom games feature expansion incoming devs confirmed theyre working on bringing Stadium to custom lobbies and are interested in buildsharing systems think workshop codes Thirdperson camera was developed with help from Microsofts accessibility experts to avoid motion sickness Potential to add 3rdperson to core OW in future but would be carefully rolled out starting with quick play if pursued Fun Dev Bits Aarons favorite build A barrierspeedheal Rein support build dubbed The Stellar Keller Dylan designed the Cassidy barrel roll damage build yes it slaps Theyre aware of goofy and creative community build names like Morbin Time for Moira The devs love that people are experimenting and making silly builds just for fun A feature to test builds 1v1 in a training range is being considered but not confirmed Misc Highlights Aaron started in game dev by drawing boat blueprints as a kid his first gig was on Soul Reaver then WoW Dylan used to be an actor and worked on Remnant From the Ashes and Darksiders before OW FOV debate 70 FOV feels most natural for 3rdperson in Stadium Full QA Q What are you most excited about with Stadium finally coming out Aaron Keller Mostly just excited to see players finally get their hands on it The team has worked on it for a long time and just wants to see people having fun Watching players enjoy the game is what excites the dev team most Q How long has Stadium been in development Aaron Keller The first pitch was made in August or September 2022 before Overwatch 2 launched The idea was sparked by Aarons son who created a prototype called The Tower It evolved significantly after the team got involved Q Who were the first heroes added to the mode Aaron Keller Dylan Snyder The initial prototypes included Genji Reaper Soldier Ramattra Kiriko and Ana They wanted to start with classic staples from the game Q Is there a specific ability or item you created yourself Dylan Snyder Yes He created Cassidys barrel roll power that damages enemies when rolling Flats calls it the barrel roll build Q Will heroes be added every season Aaron Keller Yes heroes will be added every season to Stadium The exact number per season wasnt disclosed but it will be more than one sometimes Q Is the longterm goal to add all heroes Aaron Keller Yes but its a stretch goal Some heroes are more difficult to adapt Tracer for example doesnt scale well with ability power Theyll need to design custom items for some characters Q Will there be patch notes for Stadium Aaron Keller Yes Stadium will have its own patch notes alongside regular 5v5 and 6v6 patch notes Q Will Stadium have consistent balance patches Aaron Keller Yes Theyre planning to actively patch and support Stadium especially in Season 16 to show how serious they are about it Q Will Stadium get a build sharing system like Deadlocks loadouts Aaron Keller They love that idea and are seriously considering it perhaps similar to workshop codes where you can importexport builds No firm confirmation yet but devs responded enthusiastically Q Can we test builds with friends in trainingcustom games Aaron Keller Theyre working on bringing Stadium to Custom Games which would allow players to test builds freely No date yet but its a priority Q Will Stadiumexclusive maps ever come to core game modes Aaron Keller Not currently planned The maps werent designed with base game modes in mind but theyre open to using future ones as a base for other modes Stadium maps might fit Arcade or Arena modes Q Will there be thirdperson support for heroes with transformations Winston Ramattra Bastion Dylan Snyder Theyve consulted Microsoft accessibility experts on this Custom animations and camera adjustments are used to reduce motion sickness They havent tackled transformationheavy heroes yet but have plans in place Q Could thirdperson be added to the base game Aaron Keller Possibly Theyll wait for community feedback after Stadium launches If added it would be gradual maybe starting in Quick Play then expanding The team is split on whether it gives unfair advantages eg peeking but its being considered Q What got you into game development Dylan

Heading into Season 16 with XIM left unchecked Lengthy informative nonrant post for devs tech experts and players Replay code is provided at the end Moderators I read through your rules regarding this topic and thats why I want to be as thorough and adhering as possible Devs this post is purely created with the intention for you to investigate how and when this hardware is currently used you are already aware what it is used for as per your Spotlight QAs These players have been reported by everyone in my team without even asking them to they already knew from the start TLDR Comprehensive explanation to how Ximmers navigate comp A problem invalidated too much during S15 that should be spoken about more calmly and clearly instead of angrily Slight amount of personal experiences to better define the shape of the problem Some ideas for solutions are shared Location EU My replay code is just an example of MANY matches I and many others have had to deal with # 1 Introduction Ive wanted to make this post for a really long time since about 2025 days into S15 but I always held hope that things would resolve Ive seen so many posts from Platinum and Diamond players completely invalidated by higher rank users when they try to explain theres a new Xim epidemic I hope for those players this post can be a bit of relief that youre not alone Below you will find two videos attached each showing the perspective of Xim users on the Platinum Diamond and Masters range synchronously For people who arent aware of it this is how it looks Widowmaker on XIM lvl 1 endorsement fresh Xbox account matching with other duo Ashe on XIM lvl 1 endorsement fresh Xbox account matching with other duo Might be jittery thumbs new player whos just really good Lets look further Ive censored half of the gamertag to prevent witchhunting These short acronyms for xim specifically this one there are hundreds of them for different games a lot of them for Overwatch as this is NOT the first time seeing it written in such a way # 2 Why have I used the word epidemic Since right before the start of Season 15 the increase of XIM users has been substantially visible When Season 15 started numerous rumors and posts have spread claiming that as an emulator XIM has managed to bypass current rules and can camouflage itself as a controller more than before People report these findings through digging in their forums finding that a new patch went out which is highly believable considering how different it feels now There are people proudly posting XIM montages on popular platforms such as Instagram Tiktok Youtube further incentivizing players who have felt left out common phrase used everyone is ximming you might as well xim too or cheated out of the system buying this prohibited hardware Remember my word usage Increase # 3 How easily this can happen and why ban waves arent necessarily the answer First of all I hope I dont sound rude by claiming your current measures arent the answer but Id like to explain myself with what I mean by the heading Its what I call availability Ximmers follow 3 very routine steps which I wont go into detail to prevent this spread 1 Account creation estimated time required 5 minutes if the account isnt bought this includes email etc 2 Not necessarily but almost always the case an Xbox LFG Post titled something like 50 QP wins quick need 50 qp wins will carry need mercy for 50qp wins Of course a lot of these posts can just be smurf accounts however they purposefully place the tag #xim so 3 Competitive access comes right after the player has reached placements Let me be clear ban waves are totally ineffective to cheaters who genuinely enjoy playing Overwatch They will NOT stop creating 5minute alt accounts to Xim with and thats without mentioning the hidden economical gains behind boosting Ban account creation A ceaseless loop How often does this happen Theres no objective data From my personal experience hardcore Xim users appear 6 to 14 times a week It also depends on if its the same ximmers because that does happen # 3a What happens during and after the placement matches lengthy explanation of scenarios ahead SPECIFIC TO PLATINUM DIAMOND MASTER M5 M3 the matchmaking is COMPLETELY destroyed The ximmers at their own benefit disrupt the match for everybody in multiple senses With the current knowledge that everybody in these ranks knows when somebody is ximming 20 seconds into a match 1 Team A not a full stack has a ximmer they stop playing like they usually would and either let the ximmer do whatever they want for the win or they try to disrupt the ximmer far too rare Team As players without the ximmer will go into the next match ending with a loss due to a confused matchmaker facing the ximmer they had on their team thereby wasting 40 minutes worth of comp session or personal issue overconfidence This is almost a guarantee from the research I tried to conduct with people I asked 2 Team A game 2 A full stack with 1 or more ximmers who are boosting This is an automatic loss for the nonximmer team below Masters but admittedly it does depend on if youre in a mirrored Masters lobby just because the game sense is better and things like this are easier to coordinate Of course this does not excuse the behavior at all and it still likely causes a landslide disparityloss 3 What ximmers like to do mass report if they lose and it works Yeah for some reason this is really common then they come back with fresh accounts and do it all over again Your main gets suspended and they pop out like whackamoles for several more rounds Side tip this wasnt about chatting but it reminds me to say this dont risk defending yourself in chat when a ximmer is being toxic to you they will tell everyone to report you for anything under communication Report them for harassing you and move on 4 Common knowledge but like with smurf accounts the matchmaker is tilted and confused with who to place where because of ximmers How often this happens seems to be making the problem far worse Short anecdote During my D4 matches I had one where the enemy team was a full gold team with a ximmer who had the game sense of an M5 The ximmer went 33 5 and the rest of their team were all below 10 kills each with multiple deaths and accounts showing gold gold gold None of them seem to have had a grasp of what was happening That team did not lose because ours was better they lost because my whole team focused the solo ximmer who was likely boosting that account they were playing on The ximmer stopped trying on round 2 and stayed AFK making the opposite team 1 DPS The thing is ximmers on alt accounts dont have to care because it does not affect their main account 5 D4 to M5 You will get ximmers or people boosted by Xim usage in your team who have absolutely no idea what theyre doing This is especially frustrating when you watch postmatch replays and they arent even at Platinum level it is blatantly obvious they didnt get there through sheer grind and it even seems that theyre throwing on purpose at first It is worse when you see theyve been ximming and making you lose These are losses nobody needs losses we annoyingly get over when we say it happens This is what people are frustrated about when on console people ask has anyone else seen bots in Diamond or just me Ximmers usually have aim and strafe that cant be matched but they severely lack in game awareness and that is how real players are able to tell them apart 6 Mercy pockets SojournAsheSoldier you die in two seconds from any type of burst This is the one everybody is familiar with and why console folks want to ban Mercy While I have personal qualms against damage boost this is NOT a Mercy issue This one is slightly harder to put into words but you can tell when pocket hitscans are ximming or not There is a certain feeling to it that assures you and unless you get to see what their accounts look like positioning needs to heavily be considered 5 7 Higher rank players need to stop invalidating Platinum players because many of these Ximmers fall out of their placement ranks and get quickly calibrated as low as Platinum 5 Devs if youre reading this I hope you are aware of this too # 4 Through my own opinion these are possible solutions I can think of opinions on 3 are appreciated 1 Many people will hate to see me type this I know but reenabling phone verification for console like it is on PC might be the play that can help a lot I personally think console players cant be trusted anymore to be honest with you most randoms I end up adding as friends already have a decorated BattleNet account anyways This would also cut down smurfing by at least half which even if it isnt against TOS majority of the playerbase would appreciate 2 Increasing the FOV While this seems like a technical issue currently I think it would be beneficial to combat Ximmers Xim users unless theyre on Genji make themselves as untouchable as possible because they cant risk the so called delay they have They often put themselves in godspots and heavens where nobody in their rank would play on for more than 1 minute at a time These spots are often hard to see with the current low FOV thats my point 3 50 QP wins arent enough for a common player to understand Overwatch I think this should be extended far more maybe double An original idea I had is something that would surely bother these cheaters the most if they had to wait out a specific timer on the brandnew account like competitive unlocks in 1030 days Doing something like this carries two benefits an uptick of account creations for Overwatch which can be closely monitored and perhaps bracketed players coming back to Overwatch or players excited for the new season are for the most part worryfree for at least 1030 days 4 Break the sequence Ive explained to you what the basic process for a ximmer looks like There has to be a way to train Defense Matrix to see that a new user doing 50 quickplay wins also accompanied by a Mercy pocket with above average capabilities heading right into comp once theyre done and smashing through placements should be an immediate flag for the system 5 IP bans No explanation needed People accused of cheating when they are on controller are completely fine or so I hope the game detects controllers 0 aim smoothing etc We in Diamond and M5 for me have all been reported for cheating one way or another and nothing happened because were on controller But a brandnew account that is detected by Defense Matrix and placed into PC lobbies until they stop doing it is not a solution in fact it makes the problem even worse Now PC players have to deal with ximmers who Im pretty sure have had their aim assist revoked so they get a cheater deadweight on their team But not only that whats worse is that ximmers use this as a bell to alert them when their account is compromised That is their prime time for creating a new one and being stealthier about it or not People detected of ximming 100 by the system need to be IP banned if they cant be hardware banned Cheaters have no reason to be in a competitive FPS like Overwatch or any other competitive FPS for that matter # 5 Conclusion I will fully cooperate if more details are needed and I dont claim to be an expert Im just another gamer who waited too long to post about it I love Overwatch especially now with these exciting seasons but this is undeniably disgusting and it has gotten out of hand Like senior system designer Gavin Winter said these cheaters are holding people with disabilities hostage by abusing third party accessories So what happens in the match that made me post this Within 20 seconds my whole team knew there were ximmers this was at like midnight and we were all chillin I was in a duo the rest were randoms The Winston was really good actually but even he didnt care either None of us did so we messed around and did what we wanted going for kills on whoever we saw All of them were kind we all endorsed each other and wished each other a goodnight Classically the Dva on the opposite team says gg after the ximmers make their clips It is unknown who was being boosted but we suspect the Ana was Her profile showed goldplat hardstuck and suddenly this season shes Masters with extremely slow reflexes As someone who worked very hard to reach M5 last year I would never place that Ana above P4 If you made it this far thank you so much for taking your time reading this Replay code

Sombra Moira I deal with both generally well as damage or support class but theres games where your team are negative kd and will not group up acknowledge danger pings or communication like group up vs the sombraMoira and just continuously die on a conveyor belt while playing like its a singleplayer campaign These 2 characters are the most picked among QP purely because this mode lacks coordination and they thrive on this If either of them are backline and at least 2 teammates arent marshalling together then its pretty much game over They mop the floor with casual fps players Its also shown when players start the game as traditional gun heroes like soldier soj Cassidy and then switch to sombra or Moira out of bitterness and begin actually putting up stat numbers this happens A LOT Players that cant commit to aiming will crutch these 2 broken characters Sombra virus 8 second hack 10 second translocator should only be usable when damage hasnt been received for 12 seconds because its ridiculous seeing her players retreating from most fights instantly at the first sign of combat only to have her cooldowns back in no time to begin harassing again This character type should be specialist precision requiring good judgment and planning but currently her entire kit is just pick up have immediate impact Its lazy and a waste of what could be an interesting hero Moira fade 9 seconds this is my main gripe with her It gives her too much agency for bad positioning and punishment of enemy dpssupport players If she had longer fade time then it would make her offense require good judgment because currently she is far too often used for mobility for players that are scared to commit to fights much like the aforementioned Sombra I understand that shes a offensive support but the fact that most players who play her confidently chase and harass most dpssupportat least in QP is a sign that she needs reworking from a development standpoint I used her for quite some time 2 years ago and absolutely destroyed teams yet felt next to no joy from doing this She just feels broken If they took her heal orb away and made her dps she would make much more sense than her current state in support Overall I think Overwatch 2 needs longer ability replenishment times for most characters something that would slow the pace down and make battles more memorable skillbased Currently most fights are a blender of ability spam and who 2v1s more often Abilities should feel powerful in the sense that they are potential gamechangers at the expense of messing up,Sombra Moira I

Changes Id love to see in overwatch Long time a lurker here Sometimes when I play overwatch I think of some changes I love to see made in the game Some have a simple quality of life and some are ridiculous Id love to know your thoughts 1 When heroes die their abilities stop Great nerfs for Brigs Inspire Moiras Orbs 2 When the hero dies their deployable break Once my dead life weaver got me killed because a widow used his pad to snipe me on Gibraltar Great nerfs for Junkrat Torb Ilari Winston Ram Sigma 3 Grant a hero 100 temporary overhealth that depletes over time when picking up the flag on capture the flag I but someone getting the flag and instantly dying is a vibe killer 4 Add perks to some of the arcade modes Capture the Flag feels so outdated now 5 Allow Mei to ping in enemies in her ice block 6 Bring back LFG I know people said they never used it but that we before we had crossplay Encouraging users of a team to leave a platform to build a team will never make sense to me 7 Bring back temporary armour It felt like a really fun concept that I think can be balanced around Also I felt like it added texture to the game 8 Add lines on the floor for Clash I know they added a marker but trying to get your team to all rotate the same way after an objective has been captured is beyond frustrating 9 Update the endorsement system Make the perimeters of achieving each level public Also have reports avoid impacting someones endorsement level 10 If someone leaves your team in competitive add a modifier to the rank lost Even if its just minor I feel like some

Freedom Before Death Chapter 5 What They Say Chapter 6 The Dream Spoken Aloud Chapter 7 The War That Must Be Chapter 8 The Question Without an Answer # Chapter 9 The Answer in Motion Zenyatta rose from the ground weightless shifting into his stance His hands moved like the current of a river flowing never rigid Eryth drew the scavengers knife She did not hesitate She did not wait She struck first The blade cut through the air fast sharp direct But Zenyatta was not there He did not parry He did not block He simply moved and the blade slid past him striking only empty space She fights because he has made the choice to fight her That was the first thing he understood Eryth pivoted attacking again a sharp upward slash But again he turned with it redirecting her force without ever touching her Not stopping her Not resisting her Letting her pass Her third strike did not come immediately She stood still the knife steady in her hand watching him Zenyatta had not struck back once She let the knife fall from her fingers And she drew the mercenarys whipblade A ribbon of metal coiling striking extending She snapped it forward The whipblade cracked through the air an extension of control of command A weapon meant to force an enemy into submission Zenyatta did not submit He let it pass him like wind slipping between temple bells She attacked again the blade shifting from whip to rigid steel in a single instant a perfect execution of the mercenarys most practiced killing blow But it did not land Zenyatta had already stepped aside as if he had known it was coming before she did He could see the movements of others from her For a moment he thought that was all it was She was simply a machine carrying echoes of the past The whip lashed again high low and high forcing him into tighter movements But something felt different She was not hesitating She was not adjusting She was watching him She let the whip fall from her hand And then she raised the soldiers rifle A weapon of precision of calculation A tool of war designed to erase hesitation She did not hesitate She fired The first shot Zenyatta shifted just enough for the bullet to miss his shoulder The second he was already gone flowing out of its path like water slipping through fingers But then she fired not where he was but where he would be His gaze flickered toward her just slightly too late A bullet grazed his shoulder She had watched She had learned But not copied Zenyatta closed the distance She let the rifle fall from her hands And this time she fought without a weapon Zenyatta struck first Not with violence But with his whole body A single calculated strike aimed for the center of her chest Eryth turned with it She absorbed the impact redirected the force the same way he had And in that moment she was faster Her hand struck palm against metal an echo of his own motion Zenyattas balance shifted His body faltered She is not copying She is not just remembering She is understanding She was not a machine playing back data She was not a warrior stealing the style of another She carried it because they had chosen to fight her She fought because she had chosen too And in that moment Zenyatta made his own choice His breath slowed His stance softened Then he lowered his hands The battle was decided Eryth stopped Not because she didnt know what to do But because there was nothing left to fight She stood over him Staring Then slowly deliberately she bowed Zenyatta watched her unblinking And then he bowed in return Not because she won Not because she lost But because in the end they both made a choice Then without another word she turned and walked away And before she left she did what she had always done She took nothing from him No relic No possession But the way he moved that remained Later when she was alone she moved again The stance The breath she did not need The way his hands had turned not to strike but to guide She did not believe in balance She did not seek peace And yet the choice remained # Read Next Chapter Here Chapter 10 The Shape of a Choice,Original Hero Story Eryth Chapter 9 The Answer in Motion Read Previous Chapters Here Chapter 1 Born of a War

it She absorbed the impact redirected the force the same way he had And in that moment she was faster Her hand struck palm against metal an echo of his own motion Zenyattas balance shifted His body faltered She is not copying She is not just remembering She is understanding She was not a machine playing back data She was not a warrior stealing the style of another She carried it because they had chosen to fight her She fought because she had chosen too And in that moment Zenyatta made his own choice His breath slowed His stance softened Then he lowered his hands The battle was decided Eryth stopped Not because she did nt know what to do But because there was nothing left to fight She stood over him Staring Then slowly deliberately she bowed Zenyatta watched her unblinking And then he bowed in return Not because she won Not because she lost But because in the end they both made a choice Then without another word she turned and walked away And before she left she did what she had always done She took nothing from him No relic No possession But the way he moved that remained Later when she was alone she moved again The stance The breath she did not need The way his hands had turned not to strike but to guide She did not believe in balance She did not seek peace And yet the choice remained Read Next Chapter Here Chapter 10 The Shape of a Choice,original Hero Story Eryth

Ideas My main idea was 3 points Make his heal more stable make him more active and leading give certain reasons to use each of his abilities Now you can heal stably as charging time of his basic heal hugely reduced ally can self heal for a while and petal platform heals allies too You can also play him more actively and lead the game as you have more time to use other abilities except healing and you have two more damagegrip and tree and crowd controlpetal and tree abilities now Each abilities have a certain reason to use as well his basic attack now lowers his cooldown of abilities platform heals you increases your fire rate and it roots enemies as well dash allows you dive into the enemy more boldly grip deals AoE damage in the path and tree deals damage and pushes enemies away I hope he will be played in dive rush comps or to counter them In more details of each abilities If allies and enemies are both on Petal Platform they all go up but only enemies are rooted I thought you must be able to cancel the Life Grip while you are being pulled as it has too much potential to be used in wrong ways Unlike walls like tree ice wall jagged wall its the only ability to directly change teammates position I thought Tree of Life doesnt have its own strength at all at the moment Heal is much lower than trans much less value as an obstacle as the stem part is 3 times smaller than ice wall So I added its own strength to push enemies away once with a bit of damage I thought it fits him as hes like an antidive support at the moment Also I thought its too bad as an obstacle so I made

Just got my first lootbox from dupesrerolls TLDR its just a normal loot box nothing special I wasnt clear on how receiving the lootbox from duplicate rolls would work and fortunately got to see for myself thanks to leftover credits from overwatch 1 and grinding for all the lootboxes this season I had been getting dupes off commons for a while now and finally hit enough to get my first lootbox off dupes I never saw it communicated that the lootbox rewarded off dupes would guarantee drops that you didnt have yet however after seeing how many dupes it took to exchange for 1 lootbox i had hoped it would be worth it and give rolls that werent dupesguarantee higher rarity drops Unfortunately after opening the lootbox i can confirm it is a regular box I got 1 rare and the rest were common dupes so i essentially burned a shit ton of rolls for one slightly better roll I do understand that the duplicate lootbox fills out faster the higher the reroll rarity however i still think that the current system of addressing rerolls feels extremely lack luster Hopefully devs are still looking at how to best reward the players with lootboxes and make some adjustments to the reroll lootbox so your compensation for hitting a bunch of duplicates isnt more duplicates What i learned Outside of the disappointment i think the biggest thing i learned from this is 1 If you have grey credits save them to buy the hero gallery epicslegendaries since they drop less frequently and on the off chance you get a duplicate it will fill your reroll lootbox more 2 If you collect all of a rarity its better to wait till next season to open more lootboxes New drops of that rarity should enter the pool and you can avoid burning rolls that add up to almost nothing and get you nothing special Edit lootboxes auto open at the end of season so the current system forces you to burn rerolls instead of allowing you full compensation of duplicate drops,Just got my first lootbox from dupesrerolls TLDR

Widowmaker Needs a Rework Not Just a Nerf or Buff Hey there quick intro about me Im a pretty casual Overwatch player with around 523 hours played since launch I peaked in Diamond as a Widow onetrick but I switch to other heroes now and then especially when I actually want to climb Playing only Widow just isnt viable in Overwatch 2 Widow just isnt a hero you can play decently You either play her perfectly or her impact is basically zero And honestly I hate that Im older now my aim isnt consistent every day but I still pick her because I vibe with her playstyle Add to that the fact that spam is out of control right now Kiriko is spamming shurikens and can twotap you from across the map Tanks just ignore you because they have so much HP and microscopic head hit boxes Widowmaker feels like shes in a terrible spot design wise The game has moved on Its faster more sustainheavy and shes still stuck in Overwatch 1 I get it most of the comments will be fuck Widow and thats fine But I genuinely think she needs a rework I dont care how its done and it shouldnt be on me to figure it out The reality is most of the playerbase hates her as she is now Even when Im having a great game with 80 accuracy and 40 crits I know its not fun to play against We need real suggestions Most Widow posts are either calling for a nerf or a buff depending on who picked her and how well theyre aiming that day A proper rework would make a lot more sense I honestly cant wait for her to be in Stadium I believe she will be the last hero just because how will they balance her,Widowmaker Needs a

My take on my preferred Brigitte Major Perks Imo the cornerstone of Brigs hero identity at least how I play her is as a body guard Ive missed her ability to pick a teammate to make extra durable BEFORE they get dove I found it a very fun form of skill expression guessing who would be dove or who I want to give a better chance of survival This imo is a solid difficult choice without either option being too overpowered Obvi the extra armor expires eventually and the added cost of using her own shield to protect an ally makes it more balanced than old brig but is still thematic What do you think,My take on my preferred Brigitte Major Perks Imo the cornerstone of Brigs hero identity at least how I play her is as a body guard I ve missed her ability to pick a teammate to make extra durable BEFORE they get dove I found it a very fun form of skill expression guessing who would be dove or who I want to give a better chance of survival This imo is a solid difficult choice without either option being too overpowered Obvi the extra armor expires eventually and the added cost of using her own shield to protect an ally makes it more balanced than old brig but is still thematic What do you think,my take on my preferred Brigitte Major Perks Imo the cornerstone of Brigs hero identity at least how I play she be as a body guard I ve miss her ability to pick a teammate to make extra durable before they get dove I find it a very fun form of skill expression guess who would be dive or who I want to give a well chance of survival this imo be a solid difficult choice without either option be too overpowered Obvi the extra armor expire eventually and the add cost of use her own shield to protect an ally make it more balanced than old brig but be still thematic what do you think,preferred Brigitte Major Perks Imo cornerstone Brigs hero identity play body guard ve miss ability pick teammate extra durable dove find fun form skill expression guess dive want chance survival imo solid difficult choice option overpowered Obvi extra armor expire eventually add cost use shield protect ally balanced old brig thematic think

If you had the ear of an overwatch dev what QOL improvements would you suggest Im not interrested in hero buffsnerfs eg more damage shorter cooldown nerf her perk ideas im sure devs are sick of those opinions lol and more interested in general gameplay changes game modes UI controls etc or even specific tweaks to existing abilities that would make your favorite hero more enjoyable or intuitive For

Perk idea for Lifeweaver Imma be honest LW minor perks need to change They arent bad but they can be more interesting After all one cleanses which kinda should be base kit and the other requires you to die which kinda seems antithesis to the game That is why I think that we remove the cleanse effect for pull and make it base kit but in exchange remove its burst heal This is because the first perk I have in mind would be that the pull would now heal the allie for a set minimum and extend it the longer the grap was That could interesting as that would make into a true life line especially for the aggressive teammates The second perk would obviously remove the death perk and instead it would be replaced by a new perk where like Torb the petal platform would now be placed in vertically As such not only can it be an elevator but it may even serve as a self made shield or blockade But for me I would use it as a new sneaky way to push enemies off the maps Thought edit bonus would be to make the grip into an actual catapult but that may be difficult to do,Perk idea for Lifeweaver Imma be honest LW minor perks need to change They are nt bad but they can be more interesting After all one cleanses which kinda should be base kit and the other requires you to die which kinda seems antithesis to the game That is why I think that we remove the cleanse effect for pull and make it base kit but in exchange remove its burst heal This is because the first perk I have in mind would be that the pull would now heal the allie for a set minimum and extend it the longer the grap was That could interesting as that would make into a true life line especially for the aggressive teammates The second perk would obviously remove the death perk and instead it would be replaced by a new perk where like Torb the petal platform would now be placed in vertically As such not only can it be an elevator but it may even serve as a self made shield or blockade But for me I would use it as a new sneaky way to push enemies off the maps Thought edit bonus would be to make the grip into an actual catapult but that may be difficult to do,perk idea for Lifeweaver Imma be honest LW minor perk need to change they be not bad but they can be more interesting after all one cleanse which kinda should be base kit and the other require you to die which kinda seem antithesis to the game that be why I think that we remove the cleanse effect for pull and make it base kit but in exchange remove its burst heal this be because the first perk I have in mind would be that the pull would now heal the allie for a set minimum and extend it the long the grap be that could interesting as that would make into a true life line especially for the aggressive teammate the second perk would obviously remove the death perk and instead it would be replace by a new perk where like torb the petal platform would now be place in vertically as such not only can it be an elevator but it may even serve as a self make shield or blockade but for I I would use it as a new sneaky way to push enemy off the map Thought edit bonus would be to make the grip into an actual catapult but that may be difficult to do,perk idea Lifeweaver Imma honest LW minor perk need change bad interesting cleanse kinda base kit require die kinda antithesis game think remove cleanse effect pull base kit exchange remove burst heal perk mind pull heal allie set minimum extend long grap interesting true life line especially aggressive teammate second perk obviously remove death perk instead replace new perk like torb petal platform place vertically elevator serve self shield blockade use new sneaky way push enemy map Thought edit bonus grip actual catapult difficult
First thoughts about stadium So I have been playing Overwatch 2 since release and Im someone who really likes the game in both ranked and casual play The rounds today felt sadly very bad I think this is mostly due to the fact that all skill levels play on the same rank at the start of the season Almost every round I played there was someone on the enemie team that completely dominated the field Either its a Genji who walks around the map like its his own playground or a soldier with good aim and 10k dmg each round I get that ranks need to distribute but I have a feeling that this wont get much better All the stupid and annoying stuff in Overwatch just got more annoying Genji can deflect more often he gets a blade slash even when hes not in his Ultimate more movement speed more health etc So whats the outcome You focus Genji and the one time you get to kill him he ressurects himself because every char can get this perk So you kill him a second time Mercy comes in with much more health and rez the genji and automatically flys away with Valk after the rez perk This mode makes stronger players even stronger and you will get dominated harder than in a normal match To top that all off I cant play with my teammate who plays on console because the gamemode is only available in ranked and ranked doesnt allow crossplay What is your first day experience with the new mode I personally have no motivation to play again tomorrow and will just wait a few days with hope it normalizes a bit,First thoughts about stadium So I have been playing Overwatch 2 since release and I m

Turns out Reinhardt is Super Broken in Stadium People are sleeping on Reinhardt right now if you build rein purely for ability damage his firestrikes do absurd amounts of damage With the perk that creates lava from firestrikes it just destroys anyone who is clumped up I cant tell you the amount of times Ive wiped teams by pressing e twice and aiming in the enemys general direction Even when people arent clumped together anyone whos taken even a bit of damage just gets one shot and any tanks who have taken a small beating just melt with a couple fire strikes and a hammer hit take a wild guess which screen shot was me on a different character,Turns out Reinhardt is Super Broken in Stadium People are sleeping on Reinhardt right now if you build rein purely for ability damage his firestrikes do absurd amounts of damage With the perk that creates lava from firestrikes it just destroys anyone who is clumped up I ca nt tell you the amount of times I ve wiped teams by pressing e twice and aiming in the enemys general direction Even when people are nt clumped together anyone who s taken even a bit of damage just gets one shot and any tanks who have taken a small beating just melt with a couple fire strikes and a hammer hit take a wild guess which screen shot was me on a different character,turn out Reinhardt be Super Broken in Stadium People be sleep on reinhardt right now if you build rein purely for ability damage his firestrike do absurd amount of damage with the perk that create lava from firestrike it just destroy anyone who be clump up I can not tell you the amount of time I ve wipe team by press e twice and aim in the enemys general direction even when people be not clump together anyone who s take even a bit of damage just get one shot and any tank who have take a small beating just melt with a couple fire strike and a hammer hit take a wild guess which screen shot be I on a different character,turn Reinhardt Super Broken Stadium People sleep reinhardt right build rein purely ability damage firestrike absurd damage perk create lava firestrike destroy clump tell time ve wipe team press e twice aim enemys general direction people clump s bit damage shot tank small beating melt couple fire strike hammer hit wild guess screen shot different character
Initial Stadium thoughts Adds good variety but sometimes misses the mark Here are my initial thoughts on Stadium after about 5 hours of gameplay Abilities are all super fun but some of them are absolutely horrible to play into Rein Mei Cassidy Soilder the standouts in this regard After a couple of rounds when everyone has crazy HP fights can pretty much become endless until a couple of people hit big ults Massive HP pools and tons of lifesteal and damage reduction makes fights drag on for super long sometimes That baby Dva nano perk especially makes her unbelievable at stalling especially as the increased HP also affects her when shes out of mek Lots of performance issues currently huge resolution and frame rate drops regardless of hardware Hopefully these are fixed ASAP This mode absolutely feels like an entire new game and nothing like OW which is good and bad Its great to have more variety in the game and this will almost certainly help with the feeling of being burnt out by the game For me at least however it definitely wont overtake normal OW as my main mode Itll be a nice side show to go to occasionally nothing more or less For me there should be a little more reward if you lose a game Each game can go beyond half an hour and usually will so losing is especially painful and getting hardly anything only get 1 comp progress to the 100 points adds to the pain Even some pity comp points like 5 per loss would be better This mostly sounds negative but Im still having a ton of fun on Stadium It absolutely has potential and Im hopeful some of the more obvious issues can be fixed soon For now however Stadium is a mixed bag of fun and frustration,Initial Stadium thoughts Adds good variety but sometimes misses the mark Here are my initial thoughts on

stadium is actually so not fun and unbalanced played so many games and it was either roll or berolled no closegames and nocounter play once lost it really seems like some heroes are just outofplace in the game mode and others are built to dominate instead of being able to counter swap or even counterpick perks and abilities it just feels like your fate is sealed within the first round and youre also forced to sit through the hell over and over and over again i can definitely see this not being played after awhile and only appealing to a select minority actually absolute trash,stadium is actually so not fun and unbalanced played so many games and it was either roll or berolled no closegames and nocounter play once lost it really seems like some heroes are just outofplace in the game mode and others are built to dominate instead of being able to counter swap or even counterpick perks and abilities it just feels like your fate is sealed within the first round and you re also forced to sit through the hell over and over and over again i can definitely see this not being played after awhile and only appealing to a select minority actually absolute trash,stadium be actually so not fun and unbalanced play so many game and it be either roll or berolle no closegame and nocounter play once lose it really seem like some hero be just outofplace in the game mode and other be build to dominate instead of be able to counter swap or even counterpick perk and ability it just feel like your fate be seal within the first round and you re also force to sit through the hell over and over and over again I can definitely see this not be play after awhile and only appeal to a select minority actually absolute trash,stadium actually fun unbalanced play game roll berolle closegame nocounter play lose like hero outofplace game mode build dominate instead able counter swap counterpick perk ability feel like fate seal round force sit hell definitely play awhile appeal select minority actually absolute trash

disabled mercy mains 2 cents ive hit 405 hours on mercy this is going to be a long text i have a mild form of tourettes syndrome and one of the things that comes with that is the fact that i cannot smoothly slide my joysticks its like a sensory thing for me i have to aggressively flickmash them in a singular direction and then let go and do it again or something similar to that ive been playing video games for the better part of a decade now and shooter games for 7 years of that i have never felt like i was good at a shooter game because of my inability to precisely aim due to my tourettes ive never felt like i contributed to a team as much as my friendsteammates who i play with ive always been lesser than and theres absolutely 0 way to compensate for lack of aim in a game where the goal is to shoot people until i found overwatch in 2023 playing mercy allows me to never have to aim at an enemy whatsoever and focus more on positioning and decision making and team synergy and assisting my friends who are good at aiming ive climbed to masters i am good at video games i am insanely intelligent and good at fast paced decisions and planning and executions of plans im so unbelievably cracked at mercy its insane and im not saying that to toot my own horn im saying it because its true i provide so much value as mercy and now with this hero ban system mercy is getting banned 90 of the time i can no longer play mercy in comp and there are 0 other heros on support who i can fully 100 utilize every aspect of their kit without needing to aim and i get that people make fun of mercy mains for not being able to aim just get better they say but with my condition i physically cannot get better at aiming it is not something i will ever be able to do in my lifetime and ive found unbelievable amounts of joy from playing mercy and being able to finally showcase my video game skills and prove that i can be good at video games and now its gone just like that in the snap of a finger and if they dont either remove the hero ban system entirely or exclude mercy from being able to be banned i will never be able to happily play comp in overwatch again without deranking to silvergold at best the only game mode i enjoy the only game mode that i can showcase my immense skills on a platform where it matters i hate quick play its not even fun i am so devastated by this like truly hurt and i know this sounds silly tourettes syndrome preventing me from playing video games but its been a struggle since the beginning of my gaming career and i finally had 2 really good years of video game experience where i felt useful where i felt appreciated where i felt needed where i felt like i was providing value to my friends and teammates not taking it away and im just really sad to end my chapter of overwatch like this far too soon far too early and with so much left to play there has to be so so SO many other players out there who have some sort of disability who main mercy shes the most disabled inclusive character to play and my heart goes out to all of you who share similar stories as me there will be a game somewhere out there where you can play with friends and not have to be forced to have impeccable aim to keep up with your friends well find it and well flock to it but it is super sad to lose this game as the outlet to be able to do that because it was so fun

Confused about some perks in Stadium being useless So on Cass for example theres an epic perk called Amaris antidote It gives 25 health and 15 weapon power but the bonus is while healing an ally below 50 health with your Weapon real 15 increased weapon handling But why is that something relevant to Cass who cant heal Similarly Im a bit confused about Zarya perks which give ability power I suppose there are some perks which give grav damage and the one that boosts secondary fire But if you dont have those what does ability power actually do is it just useless Because its defined as increased the damage and healing of your abilities and ultimates that dont rely on your weapons But Zaryas abilities dont do healing or damage unless you use perks I guess,Confused about some perks in Stadium being useless So on Cass for example there s an epic perk called Amaris antidote It gives 25 health and 15 weapon power but the bonus is while healing an ally below 50 health with your Weapon real 15 increased weapon handling But why is that something relevant to Cass who ca nt heal Similarly I m a bit confused about Zarya perks which give ability power I suppose there are some perks which give grav damage and the one that boosts secondary fire But if you do nt have those what does ability power actually do is it just useless Because its defined as increased the damage and healing of your abilities and ultimates that do nt rely on your weapons But Zaryas abilities do nt do healing or damage unless you use perks I guess,confuse about some perk in Stadium be useless so on Cass for example there s an epic perk call Amaris antidote it give 25 health and 15 weapon power but the bonus be while heal an ally below 50 health with your Weapon real 15 increase weapon handling but why be that something relevant to Cass who can not heal similarly I m a bit confused about Zarya perk which give ability power I suppose there be some perk which give grav damage and the one that boost secondary fire but if you do not have those what do ability power actually do be it just useless because its define as increase the damage and healing of your ability and ultimate that do not rely on your weapon but Zaryas ability do not do healing or damage unless you use perk I guess,confuse perk Stadium useless Cass example s epic perk Amaris antidote 25 health 15 weapon power bonus heal ally 50 health Weapon real 15 increase weapon handling relevant Cass heal similarly m bit confused Zarya perk ability power suppose perk grav damage boost secondary fire ability power actually useless define increase damage healing ability ultimate rely weapon Zaryas ability healing damage use perk guess
From platinum to master in statistics Greetings fellow overwatch enjoyers Recently I decided to track some data from my ranked support games Im a kirikomoira player Some of the stats I tracked include current rank date and time maps and objectives start side if applicable hero picks game time winloss The first figure I included is an overview of my rank progression throughout the games I played and also highlighting what hero I played during these games 1 I gathered data for nearly 200 games and decided purely out of boredom to create some nice plotsgraphics for those nerdy enough to ponder over I know there are some sites out there that also track your data and games however I found that these didnt really satisfy me Therefore I decided to use R studio and create my own statistics figures in order to test my own hypotheses With this in mind I looked into if there were specific days I usually win more games 2 if I end up winning more games before or after 1700 evening 3 if I win more games with a friend I duo with 4 what hero performs better across tiers 5 if there are certain heroes on my teamenemy team I play better withagainst 6 7 what the heroes with the highest pick rates are 8 what the usual game time is for a specific objective type 9 what maps and objectives I play the most as I felt like I only got those goddamn push maps 10 if matchmaking balances out your start side attack vs defence 10 I think I definitely got some interesting findings and really enjoyed making my own customised plots However I will leave the conclusions from these data open to your own interpretation as thats more fun right Feel free to shoot me a message with any questionssuggestionsdiscussion points Notes and disclaimers Throughout the coding process I used DeepSeek Generative AI to assist me in more complex analyses as I only have experience with basic R coding I didnt perform any statistical analyses as I am not acquainted enough to choose relevantfitting tests combined with the fact that I dont really care about it These plots portray my individual Overwatch ranked experience and are subject to variability These data were collected from 10032025 to 19042025 and therefore fit entirely into OW2 season 15 I think this is relevant due to the meta of that season I made these plots for fun please keep that in mind,From platinum to master in statistics Greetings fellow overwatch enjoyers Recently I decided to track some data from my ranked support games I m a kirikomoira player Some of the stats I tracked include current rank date and time maps and objectives start side if applicable hero picks game time winloss The first figure I included is an overview of my rank progression throughout the games I played and also highlighting what hero I played during these games 1 I gathered data for nearly 200 games and decided purely out of boredom to create some nice plotsgraphics for those nerdy enough to ponder over I know there are some sites out there that also track your data and games however I found that these did nt really satisfy me Therefore I decided to use R studio and create my own statistics figures in order to test my own hypotheses With this in mind I looked into if there were specific days I usually win more games 2 if I end up winning more games before or after 1700 evening 3 if I win more games with a friend I duo with 4 what hero performs better across tiers 5 if there are certain heroes on my teamenemy team I play better withagainst 6 7 what the heroes with the highest pick rates are 8 what the usual game time is for a specific objective type 9 what maps and objectives I play the most as I felt like I only got those goddamn push maps 10 if matchmaking balances out your start side attack vs defence 10 I think I definitely got some interesting findings and really enjoyed making my own customised plots However I will leave the conclusions from these data open to your own interpretation as that s more fun right

Overwatch Stadium flawssuggestions Hello fellow Overwatch players As you all probably know overwatch launched a new game mode called Stadium I have been looking forward to it and Im surely not the only one I just wanted to create this post to get some obvious flaws out of the way so lets adress the pink elephant shall we 1 Leavers due to game crashes or other reasons I have been playing unranked for most of my time in OW but now it seems that when someome leaves in Stadium there is no replacement for that player I had 2 games where my tank left whether or not intentional and the game was pretty much over at round 3 Blizzard please do something about this 2 Draft pick please Stadium reminds me a lot of a traditional MOBA style where players lock in their heroes and play it for the entire match But the fact that the player does not know what the enemy team picked makes the match kind of random This is especially a problem I feel like because one team has a big chance of getting lucky and picking a team comp that possibly counters the other team My suggestion would be to introduce draft picks for the Stadium game mode or at least bans like they are implenting in ranked now I think this would give players a fairer chance and would make the experience a lot more enjoyable 3 Surrender option Please introduce a surrender option Blizzard Because of the aforementioned points when a player disconnects or if the match just seems unwinnable give the players a option to vote for a surrender It seems futile to stay in a match that just feels unwinnable Also a note to players of Stadium please remember that the ranks right now are mixed meaning that high and low ranks are probably playing in the same games right now but as the good players rank up there will hopefully be more fairer matches in the near future I would encourage anyone to reply to this since Stadium is a new game mode we are essentially the pioneers and we can maybe help make the game mode better If Blizzard will listen to us prayge Alright have fun in the game,Overwatch Stadium flawssuggestions Hello fellow Overwatch players As you all probably know overwatch launched a new game mode called

The Stadium mode is not what I expected 1 Old Map reuses and no extend 2 Some Heroes weapon that doesnt had ammo capacity but you still can purchase from the item shop and that was ridiculous 3 Hero counter had no solution and you cant even reselect heroes in Stadium mode such as DVA vs Zarya and theres no perks or item that can use matrix totally absorb beams 4 As Support Mains I always confused the weapon damage and ability damage which can be able to increase my heal abilities like Mercy if not the skill boost item totally useless for Mercy skillset 5 Four to Seven Rounds for win Nope Tbh what do I expected in the trailer is Overwatch version Smite had new maps mobs new mechanics but turns out it just another Poor finished copycat version Smite,The Stadium mode is not what I expected 1 Old Map reuses and no extend 2 Some Heroes weapon that does nt had ammo capacity but you still can purchase from the item shop and that was ridiculous 3 Hero counter had no solution and you ca nt even reselect heroes in Stadium mode such as DVA vs Zarya and there s no perks or item that can use matrix totally absorb beams 4 As Support Mains I always confused the weapon damage and ability damage which can be able to increase my heal abilities like Mercy if not the skill boost item totally useless for Mercy skillset 5 Four to Seven Rounds for win Nope Tbh what do I expected in the trailer is Overwatch version Smite had new maps mobs new mechanics but turns out it just another Poor finished copycat version Smite,the Stadium mode be not what I expect 1 Old Map reuse and no extend 2 some Heroes weapon that do not have ammo capacity but you still can purchase from the item shop and that be ridiculous 3 Hero counter have no solution and you can not even reselect hero in Stadium mode such as DVA vs Zarya and there s no perk or item that can use matrix totally absorb beam 4 as Support Mains I always confuse the weapon damage and ability damage which can be able to increase my heal ability like Mercy if not the skill boost item totally useless for Mercy skillset 5 four to seven Rounds for win Nope tbh what do I expect in the trailer be Overwatch version Smite have new map mob new mechanic but turn out it just another Poor finish copycat version smite,Stadium mode expect 1 Old Map reuse extend 2 Heroes weapon ammo capacity purchase item shop ridiculous 3 Hero counter solution reselect hero Stadium mode DVA vs Zarya s perk item use matrix totally absorb beam 4 Support Mains confuse weapon damage ability damage able increase heal ability like Mercy skill boost item totally useless Mercy skillset 5 seven Rounds win Nope tbh expect trailer Overwatch version Smite new map mob new mechanic turn Poor finish copycat version smite
Overwatch Stadium AIMBOTS Beyond the fact that Soldier 76 gets the perk for the brief visor after a helix I feel like every DPS Im going against Ashe Soldier and Cassidy are insta locking headshots and with the damage increase its almost impossible to play a round without being killed once you show yourself Even backline healing with small characters One thing I have noticed that the people who Im accusing of Aimbotting have relatively fresh accounts with low endorsement ratings Its rough because you need to climb the rating challenge but I feel like its just about every game Im getting insta killed to the point that I cant even leave the spawn area,Overwatch Stadium AIMBOTS Beyond the fact that Soldier 76 gets the perk for the brief visor after a helix I feel like every DPS I m going against Ashe Soldier and Cassidy are insta locking headshots and with the damage increase its almost impossible to play a round without being killed once you show yourself Even backline healing with small characters One thing I have noticed that the people who I m accusing of Aimbotting have relatively fresh accounts with low endorsement ratings Its rough because you need to climb the rating challenge but I feel like its just about every game I m getting insta killed to the point that I ca nt even leave the spawn area,overwatch Stadium aimbots beyond the fact that Soldier 76 get the perk for the brief visor after a helix I feel like every DPS I m go against Ashe soldier and Cassidy be insta lock headshot and with the damage increase its almost impossible to play a round without be kill once you show yourself even backline heal with small character one thing I have notice that the people who I m accuse of Aimbotting have relatively fresh account with low endorsement rating its rough because you need to climb the rating challenge but I feel like its just about every game I m get insta kill to the point that I can not even leave the spawn area,overwatch Stadium aimbots fact Soldier 76 perk brief visor helix feel like DPS m Ashe soldier Cassidy insta lock headshot damage increase impossible play round kill backline heal small character thing notice people m accuse Aimbotting relatively fresh account low endorsement rating rough need climb rating challenge feel like game m insta kill point leave spawn area
Stadium its great but I think this two changes could improve the player experience 1 Please make a toggle to deactivate the commentator The first two games it was fun but when youve played 10 matches he starts to become REALLY annoying Or a button so he only talks during gameplay 2 Can we get a save loadout option Ive find certain combinations of perks that Im loving so far but its hard to remember all of them for every hero in the gamemode The mode its good having a blast between this and the competitive bans but I think this QOL could make the mode play way better,Stadium its great but I think this two changes could improve the player experience 1 Please make a toggle to deactivate the commentator The first two games it was fun but when you ve played 10 matches he starts to become REALLY annoying Or a button so he only talks during gameplay 2 Can we get a save loadout option I ve find certain combinations of perks that I m loving so far but its hard to remember all of them for every hero in the gamemode The mode its good having a blast between this and the competitive bans but I think this QOL could make the mode play way better,Stadium its great but I think this two change could improve the player experience 1 please make a toggle to deactivate the commentator the first two game it be fun but when you ve play 10 match he start to become really annoying or a button so he only talk during gameplay 2 can we get a save loadout option I ve find certain combination of perk that I m love so far but its hard to remember all of they for every hero in the gamemode the mode its good have a blast between this and the competitive ban but I think this QOL could make the mode play way well,Stadium great think change improve player experience 1 toggle deactivate commentator game fun ve play 10 match start annoying button talk gameplay 2 save loadout option ve find certain combination perk m love far hard remember hero gamemode mode good blast competitive ban think QOL mode play way

Sigma can reach some crazy heights with the levitation perk I just noticed that you can levitate twice If you cancel the levitation before it reaches its apex and then press and hold jump again it restarts the process allowing you to get almost double the height you wouldve gotten You can probably use this to reach any ledge in the game for some pretty easy high ground Bugexploit Probably but I dont know where or how to report that,Sigma can reach some crazy heights with the levitation perk I just noticed that you can levitate twice If you cancel the levitation before it reaches its apex and then press and hold jump again it restarts the process allowing you to get almost double the height you would ve gotten You can probably use this to reach any ledge in the game for some pretty easy high ground Bugexploit Probably but I do nt know where or how to report that,Sigma can reach some crazy height with the levitation perk I just notice that you can levitate twice if you cancel the levitation before it reach its apex and then press and hold jump again it restart the process allow you to get almost double the height you would ve get you can probably use this to reach any ledge in the game for some pretty easy high ground Bugexploit probably but I do not know where or how to report that,Sigma reach crazy height levitation perk notice levitate twice cancel levitation reach apex press hold jump restart process allow double height ve probably use reach ledge game pretty easy high ground Bugexploit probably know report
Discussion Overwatch Stadium Mode Honest Thoughts After a Few Matches After playing a handful of matches in Stadium Mode I really wanted to like it but I cant shake the feeling that somethings just off It doesnt feel polished or fun in the way core Overwatch does Heres a breakdown of the biggest issues Ive found so far # 1 ThirdPerson View Feels Robotic and Unfinished Animations look stiff and janky Reloads have an awkward 1 second delay Since most animations are designed for the firstperson view you cant clearly tell if youve used an ability or not # 2 The Balance is a Mess You either stomp or get stomped A 5stack premade vs 5 solo queue players isnt remotely fair That said this kind of imbalance is also part of core Overwatchs DNA it just feels even worse here # 3 Builds Are Overwhelming and Poorly Designed You either use a spreadsheet to optimize your choices or you lose The UI doesnt help no clear explanations or synergy indicators # 4 ThirdPerson View Makes Everything Feel Smaller Characters and environments look tiny Firstperson is naturally more immersive and makes aiming much easier its a clear advantage especially because targets appear noticeably larger The game wasnt designed for thirdperson clarity and it shows # 5 The Commentator Is Rough The voice lines are buried under heavy filters It honestly reminds me of the commentator in Heroes of the Storm and I disliked it there for the same reason its all noise and no clarity Feels like a mumbling robot adding noise not hype There needs to be a mute commentator option in settings # 6 The Whole Mode Feels Rushed From animations to build design to audio it just doesnt feel ready I like the idea of Stadium Mode but the execution is off Right now its not fun and I dont see myself coming back unless some major improvements happen # Conclusion Im curious to know what others think Did anyone else feel like this mode was unfinished or is it just me I really want to see this idea succeed but it needs serious work,Discussion Overwatch Stadium Mode Honest Thoughts After a Few Matches After playing a handful of matches in Stadium Mode I really wanted to like it but I ca nt shake the feeling that

From platinum to master in statistics Greetings fellow overwatch enjoyers Recently I decided to track some data from my ranked support games Im a kirikomoira player Some of the stats I tracked include current rank date and time maps and objectives start side if applicable hero picks game time winloss The first figure I included is an overview of my rank progression throughout the games I played and also highlighting what hero I played during these games 1 I gathered data for nearly 200 games and decided purely out of boredom to create some nice plotsgraphics for those nerdy enough to ponder over I know there are some sites out there that also track your data and games however I found that these didnt really satisfy me Therefore I decided to use R studio and create my own statistics figures in order to test my own hypotheses With this in mind I looked into if there were specific days I usually win more games 2 if I end up winning more games before or after 1700 evening 3 if I win more games with a friend I duo with 4 what hero performs better across tiers 5 if there are certain heroes on my teamenemy team I play better withagainst 6 7 what the heroes with the highest pick rates are 8 what the usual game time is for a specific objective type 9 what maps and objectives I play the most as I felt like I only got those goddamn push maps 10 if matchmaking balances out your start side attack vs defence 10 I think I definitely got some interesting findings and really enjoyed making my own customised plots However I will leave the conclusions from these data open to your own interpretation as thats more fun right Feel free to shoot me a message with any questionssuggestionsdiscussion points Notes and disclaimers Throughout the coding process I used DeepSeek Generative AI to assist me in more complex analyses as I only have experience with basic R coding I didnt perform any statistical analyses as I am not acquainted enough to choose relevantfitting tests combined with the fact that I dont really care about it These plots portray my individual Overwatch ranked experience and are subject to variability These data were collected from 10032025 to 19042025 and therefore fit entirely into OW2 season 15 I think this is relevant due to the meta of that season I made these plots for fun please keep that in mind,From platinum to master in statistics Greetings fellow

Stadium is hype but I have some thoughts So first and foremost I was overwhelmed by all the augments is not really a valid complaint they put in a practice range for stadium specifically Please use it before jumping into stadium same with any MOBA really Now onto the real things Primarily I just want to say Stadium is awesome Its some of the most fun Ive had in overwatch in years Sure there are some combos that feel really strong and sure it probably needs a balance but overall its like a more refined Junkensteins Overwatch MOBA and thats awesome Some issues though 1 people leave a lot Like a lot a lot And once one person leaves more people tend to leave to not get stuck in a more challenginglost game Hopefully this will be addressed I get sometimes people DC but the people on the team shouldnt be punished for it so much 2 with how tight some maps are flanking is incredibly oppressive with some mobile characters becoming even more mobile than before Lucio Soldier Reaper for example We dont really have super good options to help the backline rapidly like Winston or Brig so I hope those two are a priority Third rewards for Stadium hero mastery and general payoff for playing a match are basically nonexistent which sucks and hopefully will be addressed Its terrible to be in a game thirty minutes and get like 1 tier and only time played 800 on a hero Its a competitive mode let me earn proper hero mastery too please Another big takeaway is people who know how to play MOBAs often spec better or Id assume thats why theyre specing better and so there can be a lot of antiheal and not many cleanses available so a few more options to help there would be nice Side thoughts and hopes Really hope for a regular notseason gated release schedule for heroes I am fine with big changes like maps coming on a new season but frankly since a lot of this will be porting bringing in a character or two in the middle of a season is fine and a great way to keep things fresh I hope some useless items are removed from certain characters shops Reinhardt Ammo options for example theyre bait that a normal MOBA would just disallow that character from getting Specific tooltips what I mean by this is if I buy AP on say Soldier give me the examples of what that will do for my damagehealing values Normal MOBAs have things calls Base Damage and then Ratios if it scales with AP tell me what that does EXACTLY not just that it effects Helix Rocket and Biotic Field Completely fresh modesmap objectives to spice things up and make it more unique Overall though I really like

11 game losing streakleavers Ever since 6v6 came out I have been losing way to much I have came back to the game 2 months ago but I first started playing at launch and every time I placed I was always silver 5 but before I took a 1 year hiatus I placed plat 51 year later so 2 months ago I decided to hop back on this game because I was bored and I heard about the new perks for characters in the game so I decided to join back and I just started playing comp again and I worked my way up from plat 5 rank all the way to plat 1 then a day later 6v6 came out I had a 45 percent win rate I started to lose way more than I win but I didnt care too much because I just started coming back to the game and I was actually having fun but fast forward this past week there has been a lot of rough games and I have been getting a lot of leavers and I get a lot of horrible teamates going 71018 or 916 and it just gets worse and worse but 34 days ago I started going on a terrible losing streak that just kept getting worse and worse but the thing is I was doing good in most of most of my games occasionally every once in a while our whole team gets smacks by the other teams skill level and just roll over and die but that is besides the point when my team actually does good I get a leaver randomly even if we are winning and it has happened 3 times in my 11 game win streak and I am just sick of itThere is times during my losing streak I could have the most damage or most kills or most mit and we still lose like my last game our team had more heals than the other team but we still got rolled and we lost the damage battle and I still get blamed for itI feel like no matter how good I do or how good I pop off and go crazy on the other team it is just never enoughI am now Gold1 I have fallen a whole

Stadium after a day yesterday i made a post about how i enjoy this game mode i take all of it back the perks are broken u either get rolled or the other team gets rolled immediately it takes forever for the game to finally start my final opinion on this game mode after playing it all night is that it needs a lot of workchange done because i and many many others feel miserable playing it i have to admit lucio kiriko and juno are fun with the right perks other than that id never touch dps or tank on it ive seen a lot of people who say they dislike it and i really want to know why i tried to play it with friends and sadly none of them enjoyed it sucks tbh because i feel like if it was balanced this would be my fav game mode how do u guys feel now after a day about stadium im really curious edit the perks are very confusing too and i feel like they shouldve added less options to pick from,Stadium after a day yesterday i made a post about how i enjoy this game mode i take all of it back the perks are broken u either get rolled or the other team gets rolled immediately it takes forever for the game to finally start my final opinion on this game mode after playing it all night is that it needs a lot of workchange done because i and many many others feel miserable playing it i have to admit lucio kiriko and juno are fun with the right perks other than that i d never touch dps or tank on it i ve seen a lot of people who say they dislike it and i really want to know why i tried to play it with friends and sadly none of them enjoyed it sucks tbh because i feel like if it was balanced this would be my fav game mode how do u guys feel now after a day about stadium i m really curious edit the perks are very confusing too and i feel like they should ve added less options to pick from,stadium after a day yesterday I make a post about how I enjoy this game mode I take all of it back the perk be break u either get roll or the other team get roll immediately it take forever for the game to finally start my final opinion on this game mode after play it all night be that it need a lot of workchange do because I and many many other feel miserable play it I have to admit lucio kiriko and juno be fun with the right perk other than that I d never touch dps or tank on it I ve see a lot of people who say they dislike it and I really want to know why I try to play it with friend and sadly none of they enjoy it suck tbh because I feel like if it be balance this would be my fav game mode how do u guy feel now after a day about stadium I m really curious edit the perk be very confusing too and I feel like they should ve add less option to pick from,stadium day yesterday post enjoy game mode perk break u roll team roll immediately forever game finally start final opinion game mode play night need lot workchange feel miserable play admit lucio kiriko juno fun right perk d touch dps tank ve lot people dislike want know try play friend sadly enjoy suck tbh feel like balance fav game mode u guy feel day stadium m curious edit perk confusing feel like ve add option pick

So soldier 76 in stadium Absolutely loving stadium so far and I think the grand majority of heros are pretty balanced if you plan perks around the other teams picks but every single game that s76 is on the other team he kills everyone in seconds and if you peak for even a moment to like use torpedoes as juno for example your killed before they even reach him I find him so unfun to go against Has anyone found any reliable perks to not die from him If tried even choosing like entirely survival perks and it doesnt matter how much health I have I die no matter what lol,So soldier 76 in stadium Absolutely loving stadium so far and I think the grand majority of heros are pretty balanced if you plan perks around the other teams picks but every single game that s76 is on the other team he kills everyone in seconds and if you peak for even a moment to like use torpedoes as juno for example your killed before they even reach him I find him so unfun to go against Has anyone found any reliable perks to not die from him If tried even choosing like entirely survival perks and it does nt matter how much health I have I die no matter what lol,so soldier 76 in stadium absolutely love stadium so far and I think the grand majority of hero be pretty balanced if you plan perk around the other team pick but every single game that s76 be on the other team he kill everyone in second and if you peak for even a moment to like use torpedo as juno for example your kill before they even reach he I find he so unfun to go against have anyone find any reliable perk to not die from he if try even choose like entirely survival perk and it do not matter how much health I have I die no matter what lol,soldier 76 stadium absolutely love stadium far think grand majority hero pretty balanced plan perk team pick single game s76 team kill second peak moment like use torpedo juno example kill reach find unfun find reliable perk die try choose like entirely survival perk matter health die matter lol

The best Stadium comp right now personal opinion Junker Queen has pretty crazy survivability and utility Pair shout resetting with shout giving you wound healing and hard stack your ability power youll have 500 overhealth pretty much whenever you want Double carnage and increased carnage lifesteal also just buffs this further No tank comes close to the raw sustain and with how much damage DPS can do thats what matters right now Cass is completely busted once you get to round 3 Hard stack weapon power and damage main powers Fan the hammer roll fan the hammer Insta deletes anyone Much like Cass Soilder gets busted when you hard stack weapon power Couple that with decreased cooldowns and the Visor after Helix power you pretty much become a legal cheater With a Mercy pocket you

healing and damage every couple seconds Of course mobility with her hyper ring is always a nice bonus As always Mercy is boosted by the people she can pocket Literally just pocket soilder or cass for a free win if the enemy doesnt have a Mercy With increased survivability and super short res cooldowns youll pretty much always be able to get res off too Shes just really really good at making the

Blizzard can we get a lore based season Or at least story skins Out of all 11 heroes that have been added to Overwatch 2 only 5 heroes have lore based skins 3 of those were OW2 launch I loved how they did it in the beginning where lore skins were obtainable with the free coins provided you owned them from OW1 and existed outside from the thematic seasons Clearly they stopped doing free legendaries but this leaves us with Lifeweaver Iliari Venture Juno Hazard Freja having zero lore skins I like when the seasons have a theme with cool twists on the characters but having none skins that are story based is terrible That is why I loved the Archives Events the skins in the early seasons were really some of my favourites I still use the Overwatch commander Morrison And we know most of the new heroes have their originlore looks designed We are still missing Vishkar Lifeweaver we could get trainee Iliari warweteransoldier Hazard or search and rescue Freja Even for the older heroes we could still have some nice additional lore skins added so why not make it into a season Well probably the answer is because of PvE Or the lack of it and the dumpstered story missions Creating a season based on lore would bring up the questions about it and reopen the wound of cancelled campaign But if they cant give us a whole lore based season maybe sprinkle some lore skins in the battlepasses like they did with Redshirt Mauga At least give me something with what I can believe that this world still has some lore some mysteries some backstory to it and not just constant elseworldcrossover episode junk disclaimer I do love me some collabs as well and cool themes I just wish it was all a bit more balanced Btw who do you think should get a lorebased mythic Maybe Echo or Ramattra Some hero where they could go bonkers with the design but still find a way to explain it inuniverse One of the most requested skins for LW since release Since there is less and less lore for the new heroes sometimes its hard to find good ideas But they could still add more story to those heroes and design something cool,Blizzard can we get a lore based season Or at least story skins Out of all 11 heroes that have

Stadium has some serious flaws and I think we need to talk about them Preamble this is not a thread regarding whether you are having fun or not in this mode I think Stadium is fun chaotic fun and Overwatch needed it but a fun mode can also be flawed Basically Stadium is a MOBAlite mode but it fails at most things this mode should excel There are some flaws Blizzard needs to address either to improve UX and the gameplay loop in general SHOP Edit as someone said in the comments this could not work in Stadium because in Overwatch the downtime between death and respawn is very limited and rounds are more fast paced than other MOBAs Other than this locking the ability to purchase items prevents countersellcounterbuy mid round so yeah Ill leave it here but this point is not very important I still think that the ability to access it even without the ability to purchase anything would be useful to an extent but this is a personal opinion You should be able to access the shop at any time at the spawn only for the greenbluepurple items not for the major ones which Im fine they are only purchasable only at certain rounds This could create a better flow during the shopping phase because you can pick an item or sell one and have some time to read through all of them while youre respawning allowing the user to not be overwhelmed because of the amount of info they has to put together ITEMS Items should be sequential and not unorganized as they are now Yes there are categories such as survivability but every green item does something different from every blue item etc In League of Legends you have a skill tree similar system in which you pick a starting item and can evolve it to another one following a path If you know what to pick you can directly choose the ending item eg a blue or a purple one without going through the paths but having a clear direction in what an item can evolve into would be a huge improvement and would improve UX so much making the item selection easier LOADOUTS You should be able to create loadouts exactly as the suggestions tab but customized as you please So you can create an already done build without the need of searching through 100 items and without the need to remember where that specific item is located This combined with the item evolution system discussed before would improve the shopping phase eg I create a build with 4 major powers and 6 purple items When I click on the purple item it shows me the path that starts from the green item associated and end to the purple item I have chosen Of course youre not locked into the chosen loadout but it can be a good starting point STATS AND ITEMS FILTERS If you select a stat you should be able to see all the items related to that stat so you can filter them and know which items you want to buy more efficiently So as an example if I need more reload speed I should be able to select that stat and see all the items that gives me reload speed without the need to scroll every item hoping to find exactly what I need in the midst of 100 other items ITEM DESCRIPTIONS Items descriptions need to be worded better in order to improve the ease to understand what that item does This is more complicated but Ill try to give an example At the start of the round and on the first regeneration it grants 20 movement speed for 10 seconds out of combat This could be worded as When you respawn 20 movement speed for 10 seconds out of combat 2 uses refreshes every round Maybe also using different colors for example blue for respawn mechanic yellow for movement speed stat green for 10 seconds duration and red for the number of uses left This is just what came to my mind from the 15 games I played Of course I could be wrong to some extent but I really think Stadium needs some tweaks in these fields Im curious to know what you think about it what you would like to see other than what Ive just wrote OR what you think its wrong with my suggestions and how you would improve them Hoping we can create a good discussion so we can give constructive feedbacks to improve this mode Edit typo corrections better wording and text format,Stadium has some serious

Restricting hero swapping was the worst decision they could have made for Stadium Youre picking a hero blindly not knowing you may be up against a direct counter or even multiple And then youre stuck for the next 2030 minutes getting absolutely rolled when theres no shot youve got a chance with your current teams setup from the moment you walked out of spawn The entire game of Overwatch is built around heroes countering eachother Picking the right hero for the right situation and team comp is crucial This includes the enemy comp In Stadium if your team spawns in with a mei and a reaper and the enemys got an ashe and a Cassidy the game is basically over from round one If your tank is a zarya and the enemys is a Dva you already know you need not worry about the Dva for the rest of the game because you got a direct counter Solution for this can be very easy Penalize swapping Make people lose all or most of their money when they swap heroes This way people can still swap in round 1 and be at a slight disadvantage of missing perks instead of being directly countered for the next 4 rounds Prevent swapping AFTER round 2 or 3 Players should have worked it out by then that their composition doesnt work Restrict swapping to once per round Maybe even once per game Alternatively Add a forfeit button that the whole team votes on Majority vote and its an instant loss Ive seen multiple players just give up during the second or third round and start playing damage ana or getting toxic in chat because they have to spend at least another 1520 minutes getting rolled,Restricting

Cassidys Hot Potato Power is Bugged in Stadium PSA So Cass has a power called hot potato which gives you 3 ammo when you hit an enemy with flashbang except it doesnt interact with the other ammo buffs properly For example commanders clip will overwrite this buff so that you wont receive the 3 ammo youll just get 1 unless you cancel the reload animation with a flashbang in that case you get 2 ammo Heres the worst part When you throw a second flashbang that ammo you just gained gets taken away lol Hot potato is a worthless power and can actively be harmful in a lot of builds the reason why ammo is good aside from the obvious is because full house increases your damage by 1 per ammo available tldr Dont take hot potato for the weird jank where it steals ammo from you use quickload chamber or commanders clip items or the dead man walking perk,Cassidys Hot Potato Power is Bugged in Stadium PSA So Cass has a power called hot potato which gives you 3 ammo when you hit an enemy with flashbang except it does nt interact with the other ammo buffs properly For example commanders clip will overwrite this buff so that you wo nt receive the 3 ammo you ll just get 1 unless you cancel the reload animation with a flashbang in that case you get 2 ammo Heres the worst part When you throw a second flashbang that ammo you just gained gets taken away lol Hot potato is a worthless power and can actively be harmful in a lot of builds the reason why ammo is good aside from the obvious is because full house increases your damage by 1 per ammo available tldr Do nt take hot potato for the weird jank where it steals ammo from you use quickload chamber or commanders clip items or the dead man walking perk,Cassidys Hot Potato Power be bug in Stadium PSA so Cass have a power call hot potato which give you 3 ammo when you hit an enemy with flashbang except it do not interact with the other ammo buff properly for example commander clip will overwrite this buff so that you will not receive the 3 ammo you ll just get 1 unless you cancel the reload animation with a flashbang in that case you get 2 ammo here the bad part when you throw a second flashbang that ammo you just gain get take away lol Hot potato be a worthless power and can actively be harmful in a lot of build the reason why ammo be good aside from the obvious be because full house increase your damage by 1 per ammo available tldr do not take hot potato for the weird jank where it steal ammo from you use quickload chamber or commander clip item or the dead man walk perk,Cassidys Hot Potato Power bug Stadium PSA Cass power hot potato 3 ammo hit enemy flashbang interact ammo buff properly example commander clip overwrite buff receive 3 ammo ll 1 cancel reload animation flashbang case 2 ammo bad throw second flashbang ammo gain away lol Hot potato worthless power actively harmful lot build reason ammo good aside obvious house increase damage 1 ammo available tldr hot potato weird jank steal ammo use quickload chamber commander clip item dead man walk perk
Stadium is so fun but how are you guys dealing with Zarya This isnt a complaint post though personally Im not sure why she was added into this mode as the other 4 tanks can be adjusted to with powersperks As someone who enjoys dva and Orisa I cannot win any game into Zarya Ive tried every different build but I just get melted they even made a perk for both of them to reduce beam damage and that still doesnt work The fact they had to made a specific perk to try deal with Zarya goes to show its such a strong counter to them Anyway has anyone had luck with any specific builds I feel like a helpless player for 20 minutes And before anyone says dont shoot the bubble she has a lot of bubbles in this mode haha,Stadium is so fun but how are you guys dealing with Zarya This is nt a complaint post though personally I m not sure why she was added into this mode as the other 4 tanks can be adjusted to with powersperks As someone who enjoys dva and Orisa I can not win any game into Zarya I ve tried every different build but I just get melted they even made a perk for both of them to reduce beam damage and that still does nt work The fact they had to made a specific perk to try deal with Zarya goes to show its such a strong counter to them Anyway has anyone had luck with any specific builds I feel like a helpless player for 20 minutes And before anyone says do nt shoot the bubble she has a lot of bubbles in this mode haha,stadium be so fun but how be you guy deal with Zarya this be not a complaint post though personally I m not sure why she be add into this mode as the other 4 tank can be adjust to with powersperk as someone who enjoy dva and Orisa I can not win any game into Zarya I ve try every different build but I just get melt they even make a perk for both of they to reduce beam damage and that still do not work the fact they have to make a specific perk to try deal with Zarya go to show its such a strong counter to they anyway have anyone have luck with any specific build I feel like a helpless player for 20 minute and before anyone say do not shoot the bubble she have a lot of bubble in this mode haha,stadium fun guy deal Zarya complaint post personally m sure add mode 4 tank adjust powersperk enjoy dva Orisa win game Zarya ve try different build melt perk reduce beam damage work fact specific perk try deal Zarya strong counter luck specific build feel like helpless player 20 minute shoot bubble lot bubble mode haha
How are we feeling about the stadium characters right now My general opinion on standings rn Personally I think most characters are at minimum decent but I think some when compared to the others in the mode are just not as equipped for stadium S The best Rein he can do it all run in and swing his hammer be a super tank throw huge fireballs play more supportive imo the BEST designed character in the mode Orisa Very very tanky with a few different options in how to play be it with barrier and overheat cooling down faster or just flat super tanky stats She can brawl really well Cassidy lots of bullets he can break barriers and if you give him more bullets he will proceed to wall up to a squishy and delete your IP with over 30 bullets crammed into his revolver Very good Soldier aim hacks are good aoe is good self sustain is good mobility is good He can fight head on or flank and is a menace Juno Torpedoes with ap CHUNK and can hit the whole enemy team and reset and you can have more than one AND heal your team at the same time Easily the strongest support rn Kiriko just does a lot of damage healing and is pretty safe and protects you with suzu That will always be good A The very good Zarya bigger bubbles are great for BEING the barrier and with other ways to be more supportive with your bubbles you can super tank while not investing in damage and STILL do damage Shes great Reaper he can either run at your frontline or tp in and shred your back line and he cant reset on kills its very strong but cc can really mess him up and he can get bursted really quick for doing it against teams that are prepared Very strong Mei the mini tank flanking menace to society Having a second tank that does damage is pretty good especially with stronger zoning with the blizzard wall Lucio has a few build is probably the most fun support He can run speed boost more and swap back to heal for bigger bursts allowing him to stall longer and rush his team in more aggressively Beyond this on certain maps he can really get oppressive with double boops and the residual crossfade effects are great not to mention mini sound barriers Very nice very fun clip that shit Ana anti nade will always be strong and Ana can do A LOT of damage if she specks into it and has a lot of utility That said tight maps means there are a lot of moments youll lose line of sight so she isnt perfect but shes very good if you can aim and can take down Juno and other menaces Moira 1 ball was oppressive 4 balls is pure madness and combine that with increasing her damage and Moira is a DPS healer B The Good DVA very annoying to deal with good harass pretty safe with going in and out but does struggle a bit with Mei and Zarya being present even with the perk to beat beams That said bomb is pretty useful on a lot of maps and she can bully remove healers and knock people around Solid but offers much less compared to a Rein or Zarya Genji very much more of what Genji already does flank harass dash reset You can go for more Shurikens stronger blade or more I frames on dash but generally Id rather have Soldier or Reaper than Genji Ashe very hit or miss Bob is always useful but ultimately a lot of the fire perks and AP Ashe just feels like a trap and shes very easy to dive and kill Generally speaking in my experience Ashes who can hit headshots will outperform triple dynamite mini bob Ashes 9 times out of 10 Maybe when more people learn how to build shell seem better but right now shes a plain skill check for the person playing her which I cant really say about Cowboy with his spammy fun hijinks C Okay Mercy she is essentially just normal Mercy A lot of her powers feel mediocre or very situational and you dont really seem to benefit much from AP unless youre building very specific AP scaling perks and items as her staff and gun seem to scale with AD Dont know the exact ratios of how things actually effect her staff but honestly she is just a skill check on the Mercy player and the enemy team If they aim at you you will die and be useless without help if they dont you get to freely fly about and heal for 49k a round I really feel she is probably the worst in terms of execution as no perk is really exciting to use D No Junker Queen I have heard tales of the unkillable monster Queen but have never seen this Kiri Ana Orisa Rein all bully the crap out of queen and Ive yet to see a Queen win where it was because of the queen and not a DPS hard carrying while Queen just kinda exists Some of her powers are cool and some are cool only in concept not execution like the leaping carnage is REALLY mediocre and basically a tiny hop Shout reset build is fine but again Kiri exists and people can build to punish having a huge amount of HP so I feel Queen just isnt there Would love to see the leap perk actually turn into a special effect with a bigger jump and a slam or something to actually make queen be more disruptive and impactful because right now she just gets bounced around in my experience What do you all think of the characters in stadium right now What changes would you like to see to the cast perksitems etc,How are we feeling about the stadium characters right

Did they nerf Rein when I wasnt looking Why So I dont know if Im just an idiot but I just played a game and Reins health was 550 AND one of his perks has been changed I remember playing games a few days ago where his health was 700 and I have clips saved on my console showing me with 700 health when I walk out of the room Am I insane What is happening Also his first perk has been changed No longer does it let the firestrike recharge his shield which can be extremely handy with helping keep you and your team alive and instead it just gives you an extra firestrike if you stun which I think is bull as Reins charge is while fun doesnt do as much damage for how finkiy it is to actually pin someone,Did they nerf Rein when I was nt looking Why So I do nt know if I m just an idiot but I just played a game and Reins health was 550 AND one of his perks has been changed I remember playing games a few days ago where his health was 700 and I have clips saved on my console showing me with 700 health when I walk out of the room Am I insane What is happening Also his first perk has been changed No longer does it let the firestrike recharge his shield which can be extremely handy with helping keep you and your team alive and instead it just gives you an extra firestrike if you stun which I think is bull as Reins charge is while fun does nt do as much damage for how finkiy it is to actually pin someone,do they nerf Rein when I be not look why so I do not know if I m just an idiot but I just play a game and Reins health be 550 and one of his perk have be change I remember play game a few day ago where his health be 700 and I have clip save on my console show I with 700 health when I walk out of the room be I insane what be happen also his first perk have be change no long do it let the firestrike recharge his shield which can be extremely handy with help keep you and your team alive and instead it just give you an extra firestrike if you stun which I think be bull as Reins charge be while fun do not do as much damage for how finkiy it be to actually pin someone,nerf Rein look know m idiot play game Reins health 550 perk change remember play game day ago health 700 clip save console 700 health walk room insane happen perk change long let firestrike recharge shield extremely handy help team alive instead extra firestrike stun think bull Reins charge fun damage finkiy actually pin

April 24 Someone Livestream QA Translation Someone did a QA livestream on April 24 which is also his birthday He answered so many questions I missed a few at the end but not much and I left out a few Ginkam posted their own right as i finished mine here it is organized by theme whereas mine is just the order during the stream so its messy Future plans I think Ill continue as progamer Ive delayed military so if I can resolve the current situation Ill keep going How is life as an ordinary person It just feels like doing solo practice without getting a salary or team practice other than that life is fine When do you think this situation will be resolved I dont know either I really dont know so I have nothing to say Favorite tank skins Winston OW1 Gladiators Doomfist OW2 Gladiators Sigma OW2 Toronto The rest OW2 Florida Mayhem Most fun tank and most carry potential tank Most fun Winston Most carry potential Dva Regions you want to play in if you return as a pro 1 Korea 2 NA Europe 3 The rest How was your time in the US Honestly in the US I was able to focus better and it felt more like going to work than in Korea But not being able to meet fans offline was a shame TOEIC score I never took it I dont know vocabulary or grammar at all I just speak English roughly my level is probably elementary schooler Team you want to join I need to think about it Ive been taking a break for so long Im not sure if theres a team I want my situation is complicated Secret to reaching #1 tank in S15 Since I didnt do scrims each ranked id lose was very stressful It seems the energy I wouldve used in scrims ended up being used in ranked instead How do you manage your mental during games I think I cool off for about 10 minutes and then go again If its scrims I try to resolve things by talking a lot with teammates Dont you play horror games Chorong Send a selfie thats the real horror lol q probably a ref to him playing horror games with falcons recently Reason for deleting your Instagram posts My mental broke down that day and I wanted a change in life Theyre archived now and if I feel better Ill restore everything Dont worry haha Best synergy with DPS Mer1t Support Chorong You were on the same team with Mer1t for a long time any chance of being on the same team again I can only give the same answer I dont know either Future streaming plans Ill come back when my mental health gets better sorry Any teams contacted you A few after Toronto ended Is there a pro youd want to play with No Ive tried most of them Im a bit old now I pretty much know everyone now Best thing about being back in Korea I met a lot of good people and had many chances to talk it really made me happy ENG Can I see you in Stockholm this year idk about that sry TOT Closest pro Donghak Mag Which Korean team are you closest with Falcons and Raccoon Im close with pretty much everyone on those two teams Post S15 thoughts on perks and ban system Perks really well made but couldnt they have been a bit more creative There are some disappointing ones Bans 2 per team is too much I dont know how regular players are supposed to handle this even pros dont have 2 bans each feels too aggressive of a patch Will you be playing in Stage 3 As I said before I dont know even about Stage 2 Stage 3 or next year so I really cant say anything How would you objectively rate your current skill level #1 among the regular players Is Mer1t also unable to play for the same reason Its not something I can speak on each has their own reason Did you watch the Hangzhou Clash Yes I did congrats to Raccoon on the win Whats your alcohol tolerance Usually 15 2 bottles of soju If Im feeling good I drink 3 and pass out right in bed That coop game with HanbinStalk3rChiyo was fun Will there be another I dont have a say in this I was only a substitute If they call me Ill probably do it I was very happy that they called me Hey Jeongwan lets drink MCD I dont drink with this person It was hell last time I drank with him thats all Why is your profile icon China Back in 2023 4 days before the OWL Grand Finals we beat everyone in scrims except Atlanta and even won the championship after that I didnt see a reason to change it so I just left it i think it says he had while doing all of that and thus didnt change Top 3 tanks youre most confident in right now Winston Hazard Sigma Doomfist Wrecking Ball What team are you on I cant say sorry I might be on a team or I might not I dont know either A Winston pro you felt a wall against After the 2023 OWL Midseason we scrimmed Houston at the end of July I got monkeygapped and Gunba scolded me hard I reviewed gameplay for an hour straight then we beat Houston in the next tournament Join a team that has a sub tank or a team that has no tank I want to go to a team that wants me Not just a good team but one that wants me Difference between a good Winston and an average one A good one spends more time disrupting the backline and still come back alive Its about whether he can force space with raw presence or not Are you close with EuiseokFearless No but when he announced his retirement I sent him a long letter expressing respect Then he said lets be like brothers when we see each others later I really hope I can meet Euiseokhyung one day Most satisfying and disappointing match Most satisfying when we beat Gladiators in 2023 and qualified for Midseason Disappointing losing 03 to Raccoon at 2024 OWCS Dallas Major Do you have a match where you really carried that stands out Honestly I dont think Ive carried many so nothing really comes to mind Whats the difference between Fearless monkey and others Beastlike decisionmaking Which players are the toughest for you to face Shu Fielder From your experience as a tank which enemy DPS hits the hardest Stalk3r LIP Mer1t probably would hit the hardest though Closest foreign player Rupal Current best player per role Raccoon you have to respect tournament results What ranks are you in DPS and Support DPS GM4 Support GM5 Mer1ts Ana vs Someones Ana Anyone who says Mer1t is ignorant What do you think of Hanbins Winston 2nd best Winston in the world right now As the worlds best flex tank is there a tank you dislike or lack confidence in Dont like Dva feels boring after Winston Not confident Junkerqueen if youve ever gone against Hanbin youll know why Someone main dps vs Mer1t main tank In ranked Someone DPS wins easily In tournaments Mer1t tank wins easily Toughest opponents in the 2023 Gladiators match Lastro and Kevster Which team had the best food Mayhem in 2022 the manager cooked for us and we had legendary meals Mag Sigma vs Donghak Sigma Mag Sigma Donghak doesnt like playing Sigma If you get to play in a showmatch what role and hero would you want Flex dps Genji Behind story of the legendary Runasapi at EWC semifinals Since we had to face Raccoon next if we won I just saw Runasapi as a warmup so I wasnt nervous Korean national team roster that includes you Raccoon Someone costreamer goat roster When you were known as an Orisa main was it because Orisa was fun Games are fun when you win right I kept winning so I kept playing her The coach youve liked most Casores as a person and in terms of game Gunba Gunba has his moments but he reads the game well If you win with him you have to give him credit A moment you felt exhausted by Overwatch Right now Not because of the game itself but for other reasons Top tournament matches one of your own and one from others Mine 2023 vs Gladiators Other 2022 Shock vs Dallas It will stay that way until my grandchildrens grandkids Main tank you thought was great besides yourself Fearless Whos the GOAT of Overwatch Smurf I think I respect other tournament wins but I place the most value on Grand Finals And he won it three times No one can argue with that A rookie you think is pretty good Infekted When you were in Team CC did you get any callup offers No nothing came up Scrim story from 2022 playoffs We beat Shock 60 in scrims then partied at the hotel and went to bed happy Next day they 60d us back Hydron got sulky at Majed for not healing him Have you ever recommended a player who ended up joining the team Yeah a lot I strongly recommended Mer1t and Chorong Can Zeruhh be the next Kevster Objectively I think its possible I saw his Genji and hes so fast My Genji feels like it weighs over 100kg but the way his slashes and dashes feels like it is worth at least 1 Michelin star Why did Atlanta collapse at the end of the 2023 season They got reverseswept by Spark If Atlanta had beaten Spark the finals mightve looked totally different As of now do you prefer the OWCS Finals or EWC For welfare and environment EWC In terms of personal prestige OWCS Finals Im a Silver 2 tank any recommendations Roadhog I played a lot of Hog when I was low rank to climb up good luck Season you were most disappointed about Mayhem 2022 it feels like we couldve gone further Favorite memory from 2024 Toronto In Stockholm Sugarfree Danny and Mer1t were bragging so much about running I couldnt stand it anymore so I stirred them up to make them race and Mer1t and Sugarfree got absolutely clapped lol Are you going to Falcons This has been asked like 20 times already lol Ill give you credit for persistence but I honestly dont know A time you really felt a skill gap going against another teamplayer During Team CC in 2021 when we scrimmed Shanghai not sure if we were scrimming or being experimented on it was just pain Shanghai was insane Someonenim are you going to Falcons Shu Congrats on the win hyung Also its my birthday wont you say something to me What color is your hair right now Black Which team would you want to be a partner streamer with Real Madrid because theyre famous or AlNassr because I want to see Ronaldo once A duo game with Ronaldo vs a 3minute video call with Ronaldo Definitely the video call If we duo since Im called someone hell think Im some random and move on lol A skilled but toxic and uncommunicative teammate vs less skilled teammate who communicates well Ill take the latter Toxic needs a smacking Why did you choose the name Someone I explained it once during the GenG days but back then I made up a bs backstory I sincerely apologize to the fans who believed it The truth is a friend had changed his nickname to Whatever and it sounded kinda cool Whatever means anything so I thought I should go with either Someone or Everyone But if you type Everyone in the search bar obviously MBC Everyone a kr TV channel is gonna come up not me so I went with Someone But before that my nickname was Sexyguy I seriously tried to debut in GenG with that name but got instarejected Who do you think are the GOATs by role Tank Smurf DPS Striker Support Viol2t The Shock trio Most fun meta during your time as a pro WinstonSojournReaperLucioKiriko Will you teach Donghak your interview reactions Donghak is handsome so he doesnt need to do anything I have to be a comedian to stand out but Donghak can just trust his face Players youve stayed close with since GenG days Bliss Stalk3r Haksal vs WhoRU HakRU Did you buy the Someone dance Mei emote Yes

that life be fine when do you think this situation will be resolve I do not know either I really do not know so I have nothing to say favorite tank skin Winston OW1 Gladiators Doomfist OW2 Gladiators Sigma OW2 Toronto the rest OW2 Florida Mayhem Most fun tank and most carry potential tank most fun Winston most carry potential Dva Regions you want to play in if you return as a pro 1 Korea 2 NA Europe 3 the rest how be your time in the US honestly in the US I be able to focus well and it feel more like go to work than in Korea but not be able to meet fan offline be a shame toeic score I never take it I do not know vocabulary or grammar at all I just speak English roughly my level be probably elementary schooler Team you want to join I need to think about it I ve be take a break for so long I m not sure if there s a team I want my situation be complicated secret to reach 1 tank in S15 since I do not do scrim each rank i d lose be very stressful it seem the energy I would ve use in scrim end up be use in rank instead how do you manage your mental during game I think I cool off for about 10 minute and then go again if its scrim I try to resolve thing by talk a lot with teammate do not you play horror game Chorong send a selfie that s the real horror lol q probably a ref to he play horror game with falcon recently Reason for delete your Instagram post my mental break down that day and I want a change in life they re archive now and if I feel well Ill restore everything do not worry haha good synergy with DPS mer1 t Support Chorong you be on the same team with mer1 t for a long time any chance of be on the same team again I can only give the same answer I do not know either Future streaming plan Ill come back when my mental health get well sorry any team contact you a few after Toronto end be there a pro you d want to play with no I ve try most of they I m a bit old now I pretty much know everyone now best thing about be back in Korea I meet a lot of good people and have many chance to talk it really make I happy ENG can I see you in Stockholm this year idk about that sry TOT Closest pro Donghak Mag which korean team be you close with Falcons and Raccoon I m close with pretty much everyone on those two team Post S15 thought on perk and ban system Perks really well make but could not they have be a bit more creative there be some disappointing one Bans 2 per team be too much I do not know how regular player be suppose to handle this even pro do not have 2 ban each feel too aggressive of a patch will you be play in Stage 3 as I say before I do not know even about Stage 2 Stage 3 or next year so I really can not say anything how would you objectively rate your current skill level 1 among the regular player be mer1 t also unable to play for the same reason its not something I can speak on each have their own reason do you watch the Hangzhou Clash yes I do congrat to Raccoon on the win what s your alcohol tolerance usually 15 2 bottle of soju if I m feel good I drink 3 and pass out right in bed that coop game with hanbinstalk3rchiyo be fun will there be another I do not have a say in this I be only a substitute if they call I Ill probably do it I be very happy that they call I hey Jeongwan lets drink MCD I do not drink with this person it be hell last time I drink with he that s all why be your profile icon China back in 2023 4 day before the OWL Grand Finals we beat everyone in scrim except Atlanta and even win the championship after that I do not see a reason to change it so I just leave it I think it say he have while do all of that and thus do not change Top 3 tank you re most confident in right now Winston Hazard Sigma Doomfist wreck Ball what team be you on I can not say sorry I might be on a team or I might not I do not know either a Winston pro you feel a wall against after the 2023 OWL Midseason we scrimme Houston at the end of July I get monkeygappe and Gunba scold I hard I review gameplay for an hour straight then we beat Houston in the next tournament Join a team that have a sub tank or a team that have no tank I want to go to a team that want I not just a good team but one that want I difference between a good Winston and an average one a good one spend more time disrupt the backline and still come back alive its about whether he can force space with raw presence or not be you close with EuiseokFearless no but when he announce his retirement I send he a long letter express respect then he say let be like brother when we see each other later I really hope I can meet Euiseokhyung one day most satisfying and disappointing match most satisfying when we beat Gladiators in 2023 and qualify for Midseason Disappointing lose 03 to Raccoon at 2024 OWCS Dallas Major do you have a match where you really carry that stand out honestly I do not think I ve carry many so nothing really come to mind what s the difference between Fearless monkey and other beastlike decisionmake which player be the tough for you to face Shu Fielder from your experience as a tank which enemy DPS hit the hard stalk3r LIP mer1 t probably would hit the hard though closest foreign player Rupal Current good player per role Raccoon you have to respect tournament result what rank be you in DPS and Support DPS GM4 Support GM5 Mer1ts Ana vs Someones Ana anyone who say mer1 t be ignorant what do you think of Hanbins Winston 2nd good Winston in the world right now as the world good flex tank be there a tank you dislike or lack confidence in do not like Dva feel boring after Winston not confident Junkerqueen if you ve ever go against Hanbin you ll know why someone main dps vs Mer1 t main tank in rank someone DPS win easily in tournament Mer1 t tank win easily tough opponent in the 2023 Gladiators match Lastro and Kevster which team have the good food Mayhem in 2022 the manager cook for we and we have legendary meal Mag Sigma vs Donghak Sigma Mag Sigma Donghak do not like play Sigma if you get to play in a showmatch what role and hero would you want Flex dps Genji behind story of the legendary runasapi at EWC semifinal since we have to face Raccoon next if we win I just see Runasapi as a warmup so I be not nervous korean national team roster that include you Raccoon someone costreamer goat roster when you be know as an orisa main be it because Orisa be fun Games be fun when you win right I keep win so I keep play she the coach you ve like most casore as a person and in term of game Gunba Gunba have his moment but he read the game well if you win with he you have to give he credit a moment you feel exhausted by Overwatch right now not because of the game itself but for other reason top tournament match one of your own and one from other Mine 2023 vs Gladiators other 2022 shock vs Dallas it will stay that way until my grandchildren grandkid Main tank you think be great besides yourself Fearless who s the GOAT of Overwatch Smurf I think I respect other tournament win but I place the most value on Grand Finals and he win it three time no one can argue with that a rookie you think be pretty good infekted when you be in Team CC do you get any callup offer no nothing come up scrim story from 2022 playoff we beat Shock 60 in scrim then partie at the hotel and go to bed happy next day they 60d we back Hydron get sulky at Majed for not heal he have you ever recommend a player who end up join the team yeah a lot I strongly recommend mer1 t and Chorong can Zeruhh be the next Kevster objectively I think its possible I see his Genji and he s so fast my Genji feel like it weigh over 100 kg but the way his slash and dash feel like it be worth at least 1 Michelin star why do Atlanta collapse at the end of the 2023 season they get reverseswept by Spark if Atlanta have beat Spark the final might ve look totally different as of now do you prefer the OWCS Finals or EWC for welfare and environment EWC in term of personal prestige OWCS Finals I m a silver 2 tank any recommendation Roadhog I play a lot of Hog when I be low rank to climb up good luck Season you be most disappointed about Mayhem 2022 it feel like we could ve go further favorite

Is there room for improvement sure but STADIUM is handsdown tge most fun Ive eved had with OW What are 3 things you like about it and 3 things you want to see changed Edit ugh I fatfingered some typos in the title sorry Been playing since the release of OW1 and I cant help but feel that this is what OW was always meant to be Is it perfect Of course not it was just released tweaks will be expected But HOT DAMN is it fun Imagine when the entire cast is eventually ported in Its just so refreshing and fun to create builds for your character You also get to play more games modes more often and the modes are abridged which makes games like PUSH actually feel extremely fun Push is easily my favorite game mode in STADIUM I even see dynamics where you have players develop a midlate game build that starts weak but ends up strong after 2 rounds This is just such an interesting and fresh dynamic for Overwatch to adopt So here goes 3 things I like Major build diversity Push feels incredible in its shortened form I thought that I wouldnt like it but I was wrong 3rd Person POV 3 things Id like to see changed the rest of the roster being able to start editing your builds during the very long intermission after roundend Why do I have to wait an extra 30 seconds or whatever it is till I can start making my changes as many others have stated a votetosurrender feature There is no need to wait through a bunch of matches if 45 of the team is ready to call it,Is there room for improvement sure but STADIUM is handsdown tge most fun I ve eved had with OW What are 3 things you like about it and

Why does my overwatch 2 randomly look grainy and pixelated during matches Ok so I just want to start by saying I play on Xbox series s just because Im not sure if that affects anything but basically when Im in a game sometimes out of nowhere everything except the hud will get blurry and pixelated Im not sure why it does this but it just randomly happens and will go for a while during the match then switch back to looking normal I also have HDR turned on since my monitor can run it so Im not sure if that has something to do with it but I tried turning it off and it still looked blurry so I just kept it on this doesnt happen on any other game and I really just want to play without seeing a bunch of pixelated characters walking around When Im in the main menu and when Im selecting my character at the start of a round everything looks perfect and how it should be then it just goes bad during the match I tried messing with some of the settings and its already set to resolution which is the default I just dont know that much about why this could be happening I tried looking stuff up to no avail so I figured Id redownload Reddit and ask around also the settings on console have way less stuff than pc overwatch so like when I looked info up it was showing settings I didnt have basically Im just asking if anyone knows how to fix this Because its really making me upset the game

Juno torpedo glide power bug It seems that topedo glideduring glide boost every 50 damage you deal reduces cooldown of pulsar torpedoes by 1s dosent scale with ability power I posted earlier saying it did nothing for non weapon but it seems to just be nonscaling for torpedounless someone can explain otherwise Without the power torpedo deals 80 damage to the two training bots and cooldown is 11s with the perk it reduces it by about 15sx2 or 3s bringing it to 8s With the perk and 130 ability it should deal about 195x2 damage and reduce cooldown by a bit less than 8s2 enemies 200 damage 4s reduction each But it still only reduces it to 8s Note perk only works if you are far enough away for the cooldown to startabout 5s after release otherwise it does nothing Interestingly weapon boost does scale the damage tracked and decrease cooldowns,Juno torpedo glide power bug It seems that topedo glideduring glide boost every 50 damage you deal reduces cooldown of pulsar torpedoes by 1s dosent scale with ability power I posted earlier saying it did nothing for non weapon but it seems to just be nonscaling for torpedounless someone can explain otherwise Without the power torpedo deals 80 damage to the two training bots and cooldown is 11s with the perk it reduces it by about 15sx2 or 3s bringing it to 8s With the perk and 130 ability it should deal about 195x2 damage and reduce cooldown by a bit less than 8s2 enemies 200 damage 4s reduction each But it still only reduces it to 8s Note perk only works if you are far enough away for the cooldown to startabout 5s after release otherwise it does nothing Interestingly weapon boost does scale the damage tracked and decrease cooldowns,Juno torpedo glide power bug it seem that topedo glidedure glide boost every 50 damage you deal reduce cooldown of pulsar torpedo by 1s dosent scale with ability power I post early say it do nothing for non weapon but it seem to just be nonscale for torpedounless someone can explain otherwise without the power torpedo deal 80 damage to the two training bot and cooldown be 11 with the perk it reduce it by about 15sx2 or 3s bring it to 8s with the perk and 130 ability it should deal about 195x2 damage and reduce cooldown by a bit less than 8s2 enemy 200 damage 4s reduction each but it still only reduce it to 8s note perk only work if you be far enough away for the cooldown to startabout 5s after release otherwise it do nothing interestingly weapon boost do scale the damage track and decrease cooldown,Juno torpedo glide power bug topedo glidedure glide boost 50 damage deal reduce cooldown pulsar torpedo 1s dosent scale ability power post early non weapon nonscale torpedounless explain power torpedo deal 80 damage training bot cooldown 11 perk reduce 15sx2 3s bring 8s perk 130 ability deal 195x2 damage reduce cooldown bit 8s2 enemy 200 damage 4s reduction reduce 8s note perk work far away cooldown startabout 5s release interestingly weapon boost scale damage track decrease cooldown

How I would improve stadium having played 11 hours so far Note Im going off the idea of Stadium being a no switch mode so keep that in mind 1 some minor things to improve the practice range for stadium we really need ways to force Demech or build an enemy bot to test against 2 in depth tool tips A tool tip should give me exact numbers on how my things are effected not just 10 ad or 20 ap I get what it allegedly effects but HOW does it effect that For example tell me exactly what 5AD does to my bullets or healing beam or Moira suck etc 3 gonna get this out of the way CASUAL STADIUM Plain and simple 4 Build plannersrecommend items Other Mobas let you plan your build we should be able to do it here and for the new players pull a page out of Leagues book and have a page that adapts recommendations to what youre playing against like recommend Volskaya ordanance against a super tank or weapon jammer against soldier or Elsaka suppressor against Mercy Go even further and recommend things like the nano on demech for DVA if shes getting demeched a lot so on and so forth Adaptive recommendations for people that dont build plan 5Merge some perks for characters like Ashe who just take too long to come online with things like her AP build or make some of said perks items so they have a chance to compete with characters like Soldier 6 You should be allowed to swap perks I get the idea of having something locked in but you already locked them into their hero they should be allowed to swap perks if it just isnt working for them 7 Increase rewards and improve the match history tab for Stadium 8 Make flanks harder and have less cover right now EVERYONE is suddenly a flank because of how small the maps are and itd be nice if some of the best flank angles were less rewarding and more routes to high ground for Ana for example 9 More unique items that are fun and expand the characters build options,How I would improve stadium having played 11 hours so far Note I m

Stadium starts fun and becomes a doozy of a drain quickly Dont get me wrong Stadium can be a lot of fun with long lasting final fights I really enjoyed Mei as wrecking ball I had a few of my most intense fights in the stadium these days Nonetheless there are a lot of issues that were raised partially by others as well the matches are way too long 3 rounds out of 5 would be more appropriate team diffs are snowballing because of being able to buy better perks earlier than the other team helping to get more stadium currency even by better performance it should be possible to switch heroes after each round Having a team comp that is countered by the enemy team comp wont be fun for a whole half hour there is seemingly no leaver penalty and there is no reward for the winning team if the whole enemy team forfeits I am having ambiguous feelings about forfeit options Often enough matches can turn around in round 3 at the latest with new perks or people switching up The matchmaking is worse than in QP even It seems that everybody is thrown in at Bronze and has to land on top I had my share of fights fighting against people two ranks higher than me or even top 500 not cool not cool with so many perks it is not balanced at all and probably will never be event loot requires people to queue for all roles or even are an incentive to play every hero with lets say varying success This makes matches even worse Personally I will most likely wait for the first patch to stadium to fix the most urgents nagging points,Stadium starts fun and becomes a doozy of a drain quickly Do nt get me

Question for Kiriko mains What perks do you like especially the minorfirst ones I play a lot of Kiriko shes basically my main and I can honestly see arguments for all of them So far about 80 of the time I take Fortunate Teller the one where hitting an enemy sends 2 healing ofuda to a nearby ally It just finds value so much more consistently Its super satisfying to land headshots and see those little floaters shoot off to heal someone sometimes even someone completely out of my field of view The only time I really take Urgent Care 50 increase in ofuda speed is if Im basically the clutchmain healer like if Im paired with a Lucio for example If I have a solid second support I dont see much value in it Kirikos healing usually keeps up just fine and the 50 boost still gets bottlenecked by her hand reload animation not a real reload but you know after every six ofuda she pulls her hand back and this isnt sped up As for her second perk obviously the fun one is Shuffling 2 blinks but lately Ive been picking Foxtrot movement speed boost after Suzu way more especially against comps with Tracer Sombra or Genji Honestly I found I rarely used the double blinks effectively not just blinking around for fun The two times I actually made good use of it were 1 Coming back from spawn blink to someone closer then blink again to where I actually want to be 2 A clutch save blinking into a dangerous spot throwing Suzu then blinking out and hoping for the best Other than that it usually just sits there unused Just curious what other Kiriko mains think what perks are working best for you guys,Question for Kiriko mains What perks do you like especially the minorfirst ones I play a lot of Kiriko she s basically my main and I can honestly see arguments for all of them So far about 80

Stadium General TipsReinhardt Tips Builds I was making some notes on Reinhardts perks and learned some things that apply to all heroes So with that in mind here are some things that arent immediately obvious followed by some tips for Rein specifically Blizzard if youre reading this please give us 5500 starting cash so we can make impactful and diverse choices in the first round Overhealth to Allies This includes you Ive not tested exhaustively but several abilities with this wording also affect the user and it presumably applies for other effects with similar wording Ogundimu Reduction FieldNebula Conduit Taking that 15 damage over 3s from Nebula Conduit continually tops up your 0520 damage resistance from OGF The lower the damage received the fewer ticks you get but this effectively means the perk applies to burstblast as well as sustain damage This dynamic seems to apply with other abilities that accrue on attacks and hopefully isnt a bug that gets patched Siphon Gloves This refers only to Quick Melee damage and doesnt apply to nonquickmelee attacks Unlike the Epic perk Gloomgauntlet which states Melee damage but refers to all melee damage including Reins Hammer WeaponAbilitySurvival Crossover and Cooldown stacks If youre getting comfortable with the amount of perks available then you might have realised theres a bit of crossover in terms of what you find where For example each types Rare tier has one 5 Cooldown perk while each Epic tier has a 10 Cooldown which you can stack If you want to be absurd you can pick the 3 Epics just mentioned for 30 the Rare Ability MultiTool for another 10 Epic Survival Vanadium Injection for the 10 on Ult and a random 5 for a total of 55 cooldown reduction when in Ult state 45 regular Moving onto tips exclusive to the hammerzeit man Powers SmashingFeel The Burn When you inflict Burn on an enemy Smashing tops up with each tic of burn damage taking only one swing of a Burned hammer to get to full NB Your hammer glows blue when FTB is active and it appears to hold this state indefinitely Impact Burst The 20 damage explosion affects the target as well as those in the radius so this is also a 20 damage bonus to your firestrike vs the first target struck Wilhelmwagen 30 movement speed bonus means you move faster than your regular walking speed This may not be immediately obvious if youre not concentrating Blazing BlitzMagma Strike Yes firestrikes created by swinging your rocket hammer after ulting are able to proc Magma Strike and every other strike will do so for solid damage Note your default attack speed gets 4 firestrikes in 4 seconds Unfortunately even with 60 attack speed you still only get a single additional firestrike for a maximum of 5 allowing you to get off 3 before your target can move 70 attack speed allows for 6 firestrikes though and even with 80 attack rate bonus from Reins Epic perk Plan Z at low health thats all you get Builds Im not listing all the perksitems for these as its very contextual on who youre fighting withagainst Fortress PowersWilhelmwagenTo Me My FriendsSmashingFeel The Burn Optionally switch either of the last two with Vanguard Shield Stampede Amplification Barrier Something like 80HPS healing when you have shield up plus healing 15 of damage shielded with some variations for damage resistance based on what you expect to be tanking Its nice and youll sometimes have the most healing in the team in the late game If you go for Shield Stampede you have the additional pleasure of being able to charge down Ana without fear and with your damage barrier its possible for an alert team to focus fire if you catch a tank Note that when playing this build you should be facetanking more to allow your shield downtime Use the perk Overclocked Barrier if youre working with Amplification Barrier or want to risk having a bigger shield Out of his Epic Survival items Infusion Generator adding 100 of your life to shield is alright and works well with Amplification Barrier as you can just walk opponents down in front of the right team but Phoenix Protocol reducing regen time is a lot more flexible and sustainable when youre playing dynamically Getting Biolight Overflow means youll recover almost instantly from being countercharged giving you time to shatter a prone Rein before they can recover if needed Firestriker PowersImpact BurstMagma Strike Consider Vroom Boom Boom due to the synergy with Ability damage provided youre not facing Orisa who doesnt approve of being charged Do you want 130 ability damage with an extra 20 firestrike damage to the tune of 250 damage a strike and would you like a pocket Mercy boosting that by another 100 for around 500 damage per firestrike It only costs 60000 and 2 powers thats the 5 highest ability epic perks with Nano Cola from the Rare tier topping it out However this is also quite overspecialised and losing 5 here and there allows for a lot more options and could better put into Cooldown if youre committing or survivability You might want the extra radius and sweet animation change from Chimera Maw but its a little less raw power Leroy Powers Vroom Boom BoomVanguard If you choose these powers in addition to the Cooldown perks in the first section for 45 base Cooldown you can Charge Cancel ImmediatelySwingFirestrikeFirestrike then repeat with no gap With Shield Stampede and To Me My Friends plus the Martian Mender perk 3 life regens and 10 cooldown you actually have some semblnce of survivability Also consider the Epic Weapon item Dampener Grip for 1s reduced cooldown on weapon hit You could feasibly chain charges with a single meaty swing between but that would be disturbed Flight Gryphon Glider Not a build perse more of an ideology I dont know if this is anything other than a meme pick Its difficult to control though by binding crouch to a thumb button on the mouse you may find it easier to move in 3 dimensions at once Also note that when activating Charge whilst moving on the ground youll keep your momentum in this direction during the animation instead of planting on the ground before ascending to the heavens Its also faster to go up than come down fortunately I suppose An alternative thatis also a bit of a meme strat is to pick Rocket Boots Survival Epic and jump then charge at the apex Thats it for now If you notice anything I should add or any mistakes let me know and Ill correct them I think everything here is a reflection of the current state of things though Some of this is based on opinion and may be subjective,Stadium General TipsReinhardt Tips Builds I was making some notes on Reinhardts perks and learned some things that apply to all heroes So with that in mind here are some things that are nt

FriendsSmashingFeel the Burn optionally switch either of the last two with Vanguard Shield Stampede Amplification Barrier something like 80hps healing when you have shield up plus heal 15 of damage shield with some variation for damage resistance base on what you expect to be tank its nice and you ll sometimes have the most healing in the team in the late game if you go for Shield Stampede you have the additional pleasure of be able to charge down Ana without fear and with your damage barrier its possible for an alert team to focus fire if you catch a tank note that when play this build you should be facetanke more to allow your shield downtime Use the perk Overclocked Barrier if you re work with Amplification Barrier or want to risk have a big shield out of his Epic Survival item infusion generator add 100 of your life to shield be alright and work well with Amplification Barrier as you can just walk opponent down in front of the right team but Phoenix Protocol reduce regen

they can recover if need Firestriker PowersImpact BurstMagma Strike consider Vroom Boom Boom due to the synergy with ability damage provide you re not face Orisa who do not approve of be charge do you want 130 ability damage with an extra 20 firestrike damage to the tune of 250 damage a strike and would you like a pocket mercy boost that by another 100 for around 500 damage per firestrike it only cost 60000 and 2 power that s the 5 high ability epic perk with Nano Cola from the rare tier top it out however this be also quite overspecialised and lose 5 here and there allow for a lot more option and could well put into Cooldown if you re commit or survivability you might want the extra radius and sweet animation change from Chimera Maw but its a little less raw power Leroy Powers Vroom Boom

with Shield Stampede and to I my friend plus the Martian Mender perk 3 life regen and 10 cooldown you actually have some semblnce of survivability also consider the Epic Weapon item Dampener Grip for

The Best Tank in Stadium After spending a few games playing tank and getting to understand the perk system I have had more wins on Reinhardt and the reason is because his perks are just so unfair when he gets maxed out that he can be illegal to not have him my second pick would have to be junker queen as her only way of being able to really fight a rein is by picking the perk that lets her knock people over in her ult Because a shatter in this game mode with how fast everything is A rein could shatter 6 times in a single round and nobody can stop it except if you have another Rein even Orissa feels kinda under cooked in comparison,The Best Tank in Stadium After spending a few games playing tank and getting to understand the perk system I have had more wins on Reinhardt and the reason is because his perks are just so unfair when he gets maxed out that he can be illegal to not have him my second pick would have to be junker queen as her only way of being able to really fight a rein is by picking the perk that lets her knock people over in her ult Because a shatter in this game mode with how fast everything is A rein could shatter 6 times in a single round and nobody can stop it except if you have another Rein even Orissa feels kinda under cooked in comparison,the Best Tank in Stadium after spend a few game play tank and get to understand the perk system I have have more win on Reinhardt and the reason be because his perk be just so unfair when he get maxe out that he can be illegal to not have he my second pick would have to be junker queen as her only way of be able to really fight a rein be by pick the perk that let she knock people over in her ult because a shatter in this game mode with how fast everything be a rein could shatter 6 time in a single round and nobody can stop it except if you have another Rein even Orissa feel kinda under cook in comparison,Best Tank Stadium spend game play tank understand perk system win Reinhardt reason perk unfair maxe illegal second pick junker queen way able fight rein pick perk let knock people ult shatter game mode fast rein shatter 6 time single round stop Rein Orissa feel kinda cook comparison
My Perspective on Perspective as a console player So right off the bat Id like to say that Stadium is the most fun Ive had playing Overwatch in years I have put into this game more than 1500 hours and this style of gameplay speaks to me perhaps more than anything that has come out in Overwatch 2 so far But for the purposes of this post Im not talking about the powers or the upgrades or the 7 short rounds as much as I genuinely enjoy all those aspects Instead I have something to say about the third person perspective that many of you are going to absolutely hate me for I love it And my experience in the base game would be improved tenfold if it were an option there PUT DOWN the pitchforks and torches hear me out on this one this is why I think its important that I highlighted my being a console player in the title because I fully believe that is the crux of the disconnect in opinion here between me and the general Overwatch playerbase You guys love your first person perspective a lot of people seem downright vitriolic over the idea of having this as an option over it in normal comp but allow me to impart onto those PC players in the audience a little secret about the first person perspective on console It SUCKS BALLS With no FOV slider since launch and slower flicks and 180 spins even while playing consistently with the best settings a hcpeful video can buy theres little better way I could describe console Overwatch other than it feeling Clumsy Halfblind This is bad enough simply for the experience of aiming and looking at things when characters like Lucio are added to the equation it becomes a fucking travesty wallriding feels abysmal in console first person Now for me Third person fixes all of these things My Hitscan aim feels smoother I can both flank and respond to flankers easier I have less tunnel vision and by god I get to enjoy the crazy Collab skins I paid an exuberant price for Transformers MHA and Avatar dropping so close together was brutal I understand the advantages that it has over first person that people see as unfair I understand that first person on PC feels better and that thats the primary audience to consider here but I need to level with you as someone who was not enjoying Overwatch for a long time until Stadium dropped third person would improve the base game dramatically for me From a position of pure self interest this shit feels better by a large margin Now at the end of the day would a first person FOV slider for console be a valid compromise Probably But at this point I dont think it would shift my experience of normal comp the way that the third person perspective would Its not often that I find myself with a deeply unpopular opinion for Overwatchs future and Im bummed as hell that I wont be getting this shit in base comp any time soon,My Perspective on Perspective as a console player So right off the bat I d like to say that Stadium is the most fun I ve had playing

Steam version of Overwatch 2 still has problems Im not sure where to post this but I hope that someone from the development team or community managers will see this post and convey the issues with the game on Steam to the developers As soon as Overwatch 2 was released on Steam I immediately transitioned from BattleNet to Steam Initially there were no issues but starting around the midseason 6 patch possibly from the start of season 7 various problems began to arise 1 Unknown player This issue appeared after the release of the game on Steam around seasons 67 and persists to this day I suspect that this problem occurs when a friend is on both BattleNet and Steam simultaneously or due to the difference in usernames on Steam and BattleNet the game doesnt quite understand which one to read and just displays unknown 2 Issues with showing skins from Xbox Game Pass Unlike the BattleNet version the Steam version does not display Game Pass skins except for the permanent skins and currency The skins that are granted temporarily do not appear in the collection If they are equipped via the BattleNet version and then you open the Steam version the standard character models skins replace them 3 Display of report messages Such messages have been appearing more frequently now but before there were almost none in the Steam version Every time I logged in through Battlenet I would receive reports but when playing through Steam similar popup messages were nearly absent As an experiment I tried logging into both the BattleNet and Steam versions multiple times and I found that I received these messages every time I logged into Battlenet while they were absent in Steam 4 Duplication of friends in the friends tab When playing through Steam you might encounter a problem where one friend appears as two different entries with different usernames and neither of them can be invited to the party The game states that the player is not found Moreover a simple restart does not fix the problem and it only gets resolved randomly perhaps this has the same issue as the first case where the game does not understand which username to read and displays both 5 Low resolution of the Steam icons in the friends tab These issues have existed in the game for several months or years and still have not been fixed or they are fixed only for that time and something else gets broken in the next major patch With this post I want to highlight the existing problems in the Steam version of the game It may not be a priority for the developers but it seems to me that all of the aforementioned problems are not too difficult to resolve I love and appreciate this game as well as the development team for their hard work and I would simply like these minor issues not to detract from the overall

Why do people hate sojourn this isnt a bait question to get interaction TLDR She really doesnt seem that overpowered to me metal rank rather just a skill character with a high skill ceiling but low skill floor Im a qp player for the most part i dabbled in comp for a while think the highest i got was somewhere around high plat but back then i didnt play sojourn and perks didnt exist recently ive gotten into playing her a lot and even made her my second character ever to have a ranked weapon skin but when i play sojourn in games and go like 254 and am generally stomping people seem upset by it i know stomping in qp is annoying we do it to others it happens to us back thats a different discussion i also hear a lot on reddit and other sites about how much they hate her and need her to get nerfed i just dont understand it in my eyes and maybe around the people i hang with in qp she doesnt seem overly powered shes a projectile character who has to lead her shots to get a charge the full charge doesnt even full kill anymore unless the person has been damaged a little bit her perk makes this really good with the charge being able to go up to 150 but other than that and maybe being slightly frusturating to fight against i dont see a reason why shes not considered a skill character rather just op ive had games where i go 25 with her and i seem to struggle against a chunk of the cast while playing her and then there are games where i flourish with her maybe someone with a higher rank and more game knowledge can help me understand why shes considered op again this isnt meant to be rage bait im just actually confused,Why do people hate sojourn this is nt a bait question to get interaction TLDR She really does nt seem that overpowered to me metal rank rather just a skill

Why does everyone seem to hate Stadium Mods leave this shit up Im asking a question I just posted asking for opinions on Stadium made the mistake of not first just looking up Stadium in the search bar and seeing a crazy amount of hate I dont really get it I mean I understand that the time between matches takes a while but usually I spend at least 45 seconds to a minute tryna figure out what items to buy if youre making the same build every game and then complaining abt your loses be quiet and learn the new game mode the rest is basically the same as waiting for a regular game to start maybe an extra 10 seconds to check your phone It aint that long what am I missing The rest of the complaints seem to be all about teammates and toxic people Genuine question is it any more toxic than regular comp Also really basic thing here guys but if you see someone acting toxic to a teammateenemy in chat call them out and defend it MAKE things not toxic Its very very very easy to do and it ALWAYS makes the game a lot better Seriously I think maybe this is a key thing thats letting me actually have fun just be chill and remember its just a game I get that some builds are really strong and some heroes are oppressive this gamemode hasnt even been out for a week there are only like 15 heroes available Of course its a bit unbalanced theyre still making changes and adding stuff to balance it and there arent a lot of options for team comps This will get downvotes whatever but I really dont understand all the complaining If I can ask something else what do yall want Were perks good I dont check this stuff enough I love perks too but apparently everyone is hating on everything so maybe im crazy Really though what do you want them to change or add to this game How did you want Stadium to be different These arent rhetorical questions if you comment plz give an answer I am not trying to pick a fight truly just tryna understand,Why does everyone seem to hate Stadium Mods leave this shit up

VERY LONG Stadium queue times Firstly I LOVE stadium its so fun and a breath of fresh air the game needed ever since Overwatch 2 released lol probably even earlier when the game was left on life support Unfortunately after hitting elite 5 on support my queue times skyrocketed Im currently sitting in a queue for 25 minutes playing in Europe not crazy low hours rn and it sucks I know the gamemode has only been out for a week but IMO getting to the elite rank doesnt require that much time so im honestly confused why my queue times increased so much,VERY LONG Stadium queue times Firstly I LOVE stadium its so fun and a breath of fresh air the game needed ever since Overwatch 2 released lol probably even earlier when the game was left on life support Unfortunately after hitting elite 5 on support my queue times skyrocketed I m currently sitting in a queue for 25 minutes playing in Europe not crazy low hours rn and it sucks I know the gamemode has only been out for a week but IMO getting to the elite rank does nt require that much time so i m honestly confused why my queue times increased so much,very long Stadium queue time firstly I love stadium its so fun and a breath of fresh air the game need ever since Overwatch 2 release lol probably even early when the game be leave on life support unfortunately after hit elite 5 on support my queue time skyrocket I m currently sit in a queue for 25 minute play in Europe not crazy low hour rn and it suck I know the gamemode have only be out for a week but imo get to the elite rank do not require that much time so I m honestly confused why my queue time increase so much,long Stadium queue time firstly love stadium fun breath fresh air game need Overwatch 2 release lol probably early game leave life support unfortunately hit elite 5 support queue time skyrocket m currently sit queue 25 minute play Europe crazy low hour rn suck know gamemode week imo elite rank require time m honestly confused queue time increase

I really hope blizzard does something about this So I just played a match of stadium for a discord quest and apparently the entire enemy team left except for their Juno I really hope blizzard does something about people leaving during stadium because I straight up felt bad that this person was abandoned by their teammates Im also in rookie 5 and after this match I immediately ranked up to rookie 4 and Im just disappointed in the fact that this is a competitive mode that I find really fun and it brings out more teamwork in people but I feel like after seeing this people are just not taking the fact that this is a team game seriously They all left because we were playing pretty well in just the first round mind you which was push on colosseo so obviously not many powers and perks but they leave by the middle of second round which was control I only slightly get it because obviously youre playing a competitive mode you should expect people that will play well so they can rank up but that shouldnt excuse you from abandoning your teammates Again I hope blizzard can do something about this,I really hope blizzard does something about this So I just played a match of stadium for a discord quest and apparently the entire enemy team left except for their Juno I really hope blizzard does something about people leaving during stadium because I straight up felt bad that this person was abandoned by their teammates I m also in rookie 5 and after this match I immediately ranked up to rookie 4 and I m just disappointed in the fact that this is a competitive mode that I find really fun and it brings out more teamwork in people but I feel like after seeing this people are just not taking the fact that this is a team game seriously They all left because we were playing pretty well in just the first round mind you which was push on colosseo so obviously not many powers and perks but they leave by the middle of second round which was control I only slightly get it because obviously you re playing a competitive mode you should expect people that will play well so they can rank up but that should nt excuse you from abandoning your teammates Again I hope blizzard can do something about this,I really hope blizzard do something about this so I just play a match of stadium for a discord quest and apparently the entire enemy team leave except for their Juno I really hope blizzard do something about people leave during stadium because I straight up feel bad that this person be abandon by their teammate I m also in rookie 5 and after this match I immediately rank up to rookie 4 and I m just disappointed in the fact that this be a competitive mode that I find really fun and it bring out more teamwork in people but I feel like after see this people be just not take the fact that this be a team game seriously they all leave because we be play pretty well in just the first round mind you which be push on colosseo so obviously not many power and perk but they leave by the middle of second round which be control I only slightly get it because obviously you re play a competitive mode you should expect people that will play well so they can rank up but that should not excuse you from abandon your teammate again I hope blizzard can do something about this,hope blizzard play match stadium discord quest apparently entire enemy team leave Juno hope blizzard people leave stadium straight feel bad person abandon teammate m rookie 5 match immediately rank rookie 4 m disappointed fact competitive mode find fun bring teamwork people feel like people fact team game seriously leave play pretty round mind push colosseo obviously power perk leave middle second round control slightly obviously play competitive mode expect people play rank excuse abandon teammate hope blizzard

How long have you been playing OW now Were not that far from the 10year anniversary Overwatch Beta was in October 27 2015 and it got me thinking about how I first started playing Overwatch Back then I had no idea about all the hype I missed the beta entirely I just saw the game at a store liked the design and decided to buy it on a whim I remember playing for the first 23 days and even posting on a forum about how bad I thought the game was cause it had no real story the queue times were too long for me and there was way too much downtime running from spawn to the action But I still really liked the design Now 9 years later Ive put in over 2000 hours played in tournaments Open Division and even been part of a professional team and I still play the game more or less daily I also remember how hyped I was for the first World Cup how I bought a pizza something to drink and set up a hookah to smoke while watching the first OWL matches Still miss the OWL It was pretty hype tbh Were you able to play the beta and experience things like shield Bastion or dashbleed Genji How long have you been playing OW,How long have you been playing OW now Were not that far from the 10year anniversary Overwatch Beta was in October 27 2015 and it got me thinking about how I first started playing Overwatch Back then I had no idea about all the hype I missed the beta entirely I just saw the game at a store liked the design and decided to buy it on a whim I remember playing for the first 23 days and even posting on a forum about how bad I thought the game was cause it had no real story the queue times were too long for me and there was way too much downtime running from spawn to the action But I still really liked the design Now 9 years later I ve put in over 2000 hours played in tournaments Open Division and even been part of a professional team and I still play the game more or less daily I also remember how hyped I was for the first World Cup how I bought a pizza something to drink and set up a hookah to smoke while watching the first OWL matches Still miss the OWL It was pretty hype tbh Were you able to play the beta and experience things like shield Bastion or dashbleed Genji How long have you been playing OW,how long have you be play OW now be not that far from the 10year anniversary Overwatch Beta be in October 27 2015 and it get I think about how I first start play overwatch back then I have no idea about all the hype I miss the beta entirely I just see the game at a store like the design and decide to buy it on a whim I remember play for the first 23 day and even post on a forum about how bad I think the game be cause it have no real story the queue time be too long for I and there be way too much downtime run from spawn to the action but I still really like the design now 9 year later I ve put in over 2000 hour play in tournament Open Division and even be part of a professional team and I still play the game more or less daily I also remember how hyped I be for the first World Cup how I buy a pizza something to drink and set up a hookah to smoke while watch the first OWL match still miss the OWL it be pretty hype tbh be you able to play the beta and experience thing like shield Bastion or dashbleed Genji how long have you be play OW,long play OW far 10year anniversary Overwatch Beta October 27 2015 think start play overwatch idea hype miss beta entirely game store like design decide buy whim remember play 23 day post forum bad think game cause real story queue time long way downtime run spawn action like design 9 year later ve 2000 hour play tournament Open Division professional team play game daily remember hyped World Cup buy pizza drink set hookah smoke watch OWL match miss OWL pretty hype tbh able play beta experience thing like shield Bastion dashbleed Genji long play OW

My Feelings On Stadium So Far Stadium is great fun Im really enjoying it Short satisfying games with a greater goal fun upgrades etc Ive played a fair few games now and played Overwatch a lot in the past However there are a few things Im kinda hoping for going forward 1 I really do want to see it be 6v6 This is my main one I know people will say queue times will be bad but I do have some arguments Id like to make From my experience queue times have been short and if anything Tank queue times are slightly longer 2min vs 1min Its not much but Ive seen their queue time be longest on a few occassions I think tanks are one of the most interesting and flexible classes to build You can go more tanky more damage and some do offer some interesting support powers and items too This I think leads to the tank being more tempting to more players so less queue issues No hero switching is rough when you choose a tank that happens to be countered by theirs We cant swap heroes any more and Choosing a tank that cant be countered as easily is not a good solution Having 2 tanks would help mitigate this quite significantly 2 More items that help heroes counter opponents They are the things that players need to use to help them counter the enemy For example I worry what may happen when we get heroes like Pharah and no hitscan we may start to need some abilities that help you deal with this more effectively as we cant change heroes An example might be when you deal ability damage to a hero ground them so they cannot jump or fly for X seconds The item that helps you do more damage to shields is a great example of a good one Taking a kinda similar game like Deadlock is perhaps a good example Heroes in that game have different abilities but are more homogeneous and can be built many ways allowing them to adjust more to counter the enemy In Overwatch characters are often very different from the getgo and even in stadium cant be changed so drastically eg DPS Tank Due to this some characters are just more harshly countered by others and we maybe need more ways to adjust this 3 Balancing and more heroes These two are a given and we know theyll do it I just want to add it cause Im excited for it Torbjorn Im looking at you This also includes maybe tuning down the damage in some areas or increasing the ability to make yourself tanky I know they maybe want to avoid endless fights that is a risk However taking an item to minorly buff your health rarely feels worth it and will not prevent you from getting killed extremely fast by a soldier with damage boost and damage items etc Please do comment with your thoughts and feels on this As I say the main one is that Id love to see 6v6,My Feelings On Stadium So Far Stadium is great fun I m really enjoying it Short

the only way to fix sombra is making her unpopular again Sombra used to be by far the least played hero in the game sombra is never gonna lose invisibility grow up thats as unreachable as echo losing duplicate or ball losing grapple the only solution is making her unpopular again not just trash tier but downright terrible for lower ranks HARD TO PLAY as she once was almost two years ago she got reworked into a noob stomper hero why who wanted this who benefited from this i have never heard more sombra discourse in my life than after this dogshit rework and the dogshit rework that followed it literally who likes this iteration of sombra whose only benefit is being able to kill dogshit players on cooldown go play sombra in gold you go behind them virus and shoot they insta die people cant even turn around again who wanted this sombra used to be played by the top tier players that had the most and best coordination out there i guarantee you put bans in ow1 sombra would never get banned nobody played sombra back then besides at high elo everything since that rework just fully solidifies her into a hero built to kill dogshit players and do nothing else the perk she got not long ago is genuinely just good vs low rank players obviously cant just paste ow1 sombra but personally her lethality has to go same with virus she needs to enable her team to be lethal an invisible hero cant just go around killing people my suggestion 6 seconds 75 speed as she did in 2017 infinite trans locator with cd on cast latest iteration before the rework virus removed 1s hack silence weakest

Overwatch 2 Is a Social FPS Lets Give the Social Side Some Love Overwatch 2 nailed the FPS part Now its time to show some love to the social part In an interview the director once said Overwatch 2 was meant to be a social shooter While theyve made huge improvements in gameplay polish events and overall feel the social aspect still feels underdeveloped compared to what it could be Here are a few ideas that could really help Allow us to spectate friends Competitive matches We can spectate Quickplay but not Comp why Being able to spectate your friends highstakes games would keep people connected even if they arent always in a 5stack Allow us to queue for games while spectating Sometimes your friend is deep into a match and youre just sitting in menus Letting players queue for their own game while spectating keeps everyone engaged and social Allow us to spectate highMMR lobbies Other games like Dota 2 allow you to spectate toptier matches through the client with minimal delay You can even filter by specific heroes Imagine being able to watch a Top 500 player play your favorite heroes live through the Overwatch client Not only would it be insanely educational it would keep the game feeling alive at all times Expand the Recently Played With functionality Right now you can see a list of names from past matches but you cant click on them view profiles or easily addmessage them unless you caught them in the match Let us click on names from the past 2030 matches to view profiles send invites or add friends Its small but it would make a huge difference for networking Create a social hangout hub Small fastloading maps where players can meet up chat practice aim or just hang out between matches It doesnt have to be fancy but it would make the downtime between games way less isolating especially for solo players I know there are custom games for this but I think a hub option in the while youre waiting would fit perfectly Bring back the party finder Bring back the Party Finder where players can post and join groups based on basic filters role preference micno mic chillserious qpcompstadium etc Imagine hopping into Comp and quickly finding a 2stack that needs a DPS without needing Discord servers or outside apps As someone whos Masters it honestly feels a little isolating sometimes even Quickplay has hidden MMR I dont meet a lot of new players naturally anymore Even just being able to spectate friends matches would make a huge difference in making Overwatch 2 feel like a true social FPS again Im really hopeful that modes like Stadium are the beginning of more social improvements across the game What other social features would you want to see added Would love to hear everyones ideas maybe we can help push it higher on Blizzards radar,Overwatch 2 Is a

Gambit like Gamemode for Overwatch 2 Thoughts Not sure if many of you are familar with the Destiny 2 Gamemode Gambit but I feel like if would be a good fit in OW Its pretty much PvPvE and requires you to collect points by killing enemy bots throughout the match and those points let you spawn in more enemy bots onto the other teams side Once you reach a certain amount of points a big boss spawns in and you have to kill it to win They could use the scrapped enemys they had for PvE originally Could be used as a Junkenstein Halloween gamemode Maybe Sorry if this doesnt make sense but it came to me while I was high,Gambit like Gamemode for Overwatch 2 Thoughts Not sure if many of you are familar with the Destiny 2 Gamemode Gambit but I feel like if would be a good fit in OW Its pretty much PvPvE and requires you to collect points by killing enemy bots throughout the match and those points let you spawn in more enemy bots onto the other teams side Once you reach a certain amount of points a big boss spawns in and you have to kill it to win They could use the scrapped enemys they had for PvE originally Could be used as a Junkenstein Halloween gamemode Maybe Sorry if this does nt make sense but it came to me while I was high,gambit like Gamemode for Overwatch 2 thought not sure if many of you be familar with the Destiny 2 Gamemode Gambit but I feel like if would be a good fit in OW its pretty much pvpve and require you to collect point by kill enemy bot throughout the match and those point let you spawn in more enemy bot onto the other team side once you reach a certain amount of point a big boss spawn in and you have to kill it to win they could use the scrap enemys they have for PvE originally could be use as a Junkenstein Halloween gamemode maybe sorry if this do not make sense but it come to I while I be high,gambit like Gamemode Overwatch 2 thought sure familar Destiny 2 Gamemode Gambit feel like good fit OW pretty pvpve require collect point kill enemy bot match point let spawn enemy bot team reach certain point big boss spawn kill win use scrap enemys PvE originally use Junkenstein Halloween gamemode maybe sorry sense come high
Support Main Learns New Roles I have been a support main for a looooong time I started playing after launch in 2016 and mainly played DPS but eventually switched to support because nobody was playing that role Put 2000 hours in the game 1000 hours in support and 500 on Ana alone Nearly hit GM as Ana in OW1 and only hit Masters as a Support in OW2 Stayed like this till around mid last year Started trying out DPS again Had so much fun actually playing my old DPS characters I used to like and trying out new ones Remembered my days as a Mei main whipped out my Symmetra knowledge from years of watching Stevoo and swept the dust off of my third most played character Widowmaker at 100 hours I had a shitty PC at the time so I gave up on being a Widow main due to my computers poor performance This experience also gave me a perspective on how DPS players perceive a match Felt more mad at my supports for not healing me even though Ive been in the spot of the support before Then as a support it helped me realize how I can play with my DPS better and how much more I can do damage on support Now the April Fools mode had me tried a role I have only put 200hrs into Tank Had to play some games as tank to get all the rewards Fell in love with playing Orisa the only tank I ever really put time into before She was good against infinite loop Rein and I felt like I could take over the team fight Then I tried more tanks like DVA Ramattra and Sigma because I had that learning mindset turned on of they look cool I want to try them In the past I would only think Im gonna suck at them and just sticked to what I knew 6v6 quick play has me flexing like I did back during launch of Overwatch I played what the team needed a lot Which is how I got stuck on support But luckily now Ive got a trio who can let me play what I want without me worrying about roles not getting filled This all leads to the new Stadium mode I was complaining about playing support in Stadium and feeling frustrated by most of my tank players to my boyfriend They just said you should tank then It was like damn yeah I should Since I had been in a rut playing support my tank friend was tired of tanking and my other friend was only choosing support I decided to take over tank my tank friend took DPS and then we had my friend on healing Holy shit its so fun to play tank I main Orisa and I love harassing people as her Once I got on her I went on a winstreak 30 everygame with my friends We got to 5 games before we all decided to head to bed but were gonna get back to it tomorrow Just felt like sharing my experience This game got a less irritating and less repetitive once I branched out I found forgotten skills I had as a flex player and I fell in love with a role I refused to play for years Also made me realizing playing tank wasnt as awful as I thought it was going to be along with Im not terrible at DPS,Support Main Learns New Roles I have been a support main for a looooong time I started

the dust off of my third most play character Widowmaker at 100 hour I have a shitty pc at the time so I give up on be a Widow main due to my computer poor performance this experience also give I a perspective on how DPS player perceive a match Felt more mad at my support for not heal I even though I ve be in the spot of the support before then as a support it help I realize how I can play with my dps well and how much more I can do damage on support now the April Fools mode have I try a role I have only put 200hrs into Tank have to play some game as tank to get all the reward fall in love with play Orisa the only tank I ever really put time into before she be good against infinite loop Rein and I feel like I could take over the team fight then I try more tank like DVA Ramattra and Sigma because I have that learn mindset turn on of they look cool I want to try they in the past I would only think I m go to suck at they and just stick to what I know 6v6 quick play have I flex like I do back during launch of Overwatch I play what the team need a lot which be how I get stick on support but luckily now I ve get a trio who can let I play what I want without I worry about role not getting fill this all lead to the new Stadium mode I be complain about play support in Stadium and feeling frustrated by most of my tank player to my boyfriend they just say you should tank then it be like damn yeah I should since I have be in a rut playing support my tank friend be tired of tanking and my other friend be only choose support I decide to take over tank my tank friend take DPS and

Late Game Zarya Build So Ive been goofing around with Zarya lately in Stadium and a straight damage build goes HARD late game Has anyone else tried this This build really starts to take off after the 3rd round though It feels like a trust the process type build I just got out of a game where we reverse swept and this is after my teammates were calling me AI and trash Im willing to lose the first few rounds if that means we get to the 7th with a full build online Ill try to explain my build as best as possible Not having a talent calculator blows All of the perks will be found in the Weapon category aside from Round 1 Round 1 Weapon 5 extra damage extra ammo Ability 10 extra ability power 1st Power perk I snag the one that gives 150 energy Round 2 Hopefully you have enough for the blue 15 damage perk Depending on how well your first round went R2 Ill drop the extra ability damage perk for extra cash But always focus on as much damage as you can and maybe sprinkle in some extra ammo if you have some funds and no other damage perk options Round 3 This is where it starts to come online I always shoot for the Eye of the Spider purple perk here Ill sell off any non damage perks to get it or grab the perk where you cant go below 20 energy and maybe one of the cheaper purple damage perks Shoot for a higher damage if possible and I tend to ignore the secondary buffs for most of em They arent bad but I really just want the damage For the 2nd Power perk Ill get the one that makes the bubbles bigger Round 4 Great job youve just melted their entire backline 5 times and are now rich af with a huge bounty on your head Get Eye of the Spider if you dont already have it This is where I shoot for at least having Eye of the Spider purple perk the blue 15 extra damage perk and either the perk where my energy doesnt drop below 20 or the increased range If its a choice between the two take the increased range Continue stacking damage perks and if you have space ammo Round 5 MORE DAMAGE PERKS At this point you should be pretty much fleshed out If you can afford it grab the purple perk that gives you 20 extra damage and something about crits doing more damage The secondary perk for this is useless here Ideally you should be around 75 or so extra damage For the 3rd Power Ill get the piercing beam one or the perk where you get 25 faster ult charge but the ult doesnt last as long Round 6 More Damage Perks As many as you can Shoot for the highest you can get ignore the secondaries Although one worth mentioning might be the Armor ignore I cant say for sure if it actually works with beams but if they have an Orisa then I tend to get it Round 7 If youve made it this far dont lose hope You should be fully stacked with purples all damage At this point it should be easy to get to 100 extra damage and it all falls on your shoulders For the last Power perk Ill get the other option I didnt get from round 5 Either the pierce beam or the 25 faster ult Im still playing around with this one though As far as gameplay is concerned I play Zarya with a pretty strict solo mentality The bubbles are mainly there for me If Im in comms with my buds Ill maybe spare them if they have ult or something or are going for a rez But 95 of the time Ill use my bubbles and play aggressive Ill generally start to walk with a bubble to get charge then break off into cover If a squishy is within range theyll normally melt or use a bunch of CDs but I try to always have one bubble on reserve for escaping or backing up When youre in attack mode a 115150 charged Zarya with 20 beam range and extra damage when the enemy hits 30 HP Eye of the Spider is a very scary thing to see Theyre just gone within a few seconds I also normally walk past the enemy tank and into their backline If Im in a stack and my supports and DPS walk with me their backline is dead in seconds Then we just clean up the tank at that point This obviously doesnt work if youre in solo and your teammates dont walk with you so your results may vary But overall Zarya is a real easy carry char and if you manage your bubbles and energy correctly youll be able to kill any squishy before they can even react My friends and I have been trying out a Zarya Mei Reaper or Cass Juno Lucio build and its been working wonders so far We pretty much always have some sort of speed to get onto their backline and having the Mei walls that slow her Cryoboulder is insane Topping it off with Junos Ability Power build and Cass Fan the Hammer build my Zarya damage build nothing stays alive Good luck Stadium got me interested in OW again after a solid 67 months of hating it,Late Game Zarya Build So I ve been goofing around with Zarya lately in Stadium and a straight damage build goes HARD late game Has anyone

A few days into Stadium and its making me realize the value of Leagues separate stat for heal and shield power I think a lot of people can agree that Zarya Juno and such are pretty strong Personally I dont think the actual perks should be nerfed the only one I think that needs a Nerfchange because its too much imo would be Soldiers free visors though I do think there is just a whole lot of value with how its done right now For example Ill talk specifically about Junos torpedoes genuinely speaking its fun to be able to do a lot of damage and heal but it means she kinda just does everything well She can spec into crit if she wants can just go full AP and nuke your hp all while still outputting extreme healing while other supports dont get that same raw value out of stats like Mercy To combat too much of everything League of Legends when faced with a similar problem made items with HealShield power In other words the could give little to no AP while still boosting the strength of your heal and simultaneously could either separate the damage AP scaling from the heal AP scaling generally making heals scale worse with just raw AP this meant that while you can go AP on supports to do so would be sacrificing a bit of sustain and generally you still wouldnt be at DPS levels of damage but that isnt always the case This I think would GREATLY benefit the balance of this mode Stronger late game items and more diverse scaling You could nerf AP on Zarya without completely gutting big bubbles and nerf Junos torpedoes without removing the option to do damage or mass heal your team This I think extends to a lot of late game items I think they just are too safe at times and survival items feel less good imo than damageap items due to visible effects like giving antieffects This is something I generally think could be improved in mid season and next season in making items especially late game ones feel more like big MOBA items while also addressing some of the really scummy things to play against without just erasing that playstyle for the people who enjoy it,A few days into Stadium and its making me realize the value of Leagues separate stat for heal and shield

3 Things I think stadium could use My first suggestion is a saved loadout tab Like the example builds another tab where you could set your own custombuilds This would make it good to jump into practice range and save some custombuilds for multiplayer My 2nd suggestion is allow Hero swapping at the start of each round I understand why there is no midgame switching since it would lead people to spend ages in changing their build Overwatch has a lot of hard counters especially with tanks At the start of the wave during the armoury period there is no issue with players being able to switch characters Then just give them all their money back to reload with Voting to surrender If you get 5 votes then the game should end counting as a loss Giving the other team to win If a full team isnt enjoying a game they shouldnt be forced to continue playing for several more rounds Voting should become available after completing 1 2 rounds If no one is having fun this will lead to players under performing due to lower morale If your team isnt trying then you are then fighting an uphill battle making the game less enjoyable Stadium is a long game mode so being forced to deal with this for an extended period can be quite frustrating What do you all think and what changes would you like to see,3 Things I think stadium could use My first suggestion is a saved loadout tab Like the example builds another tab where you could set your own custombuilds This would make it good to jump into practice range and save some custombuilds for multiplayer My 2nd suggestion is allow Hero swapping at the start of each round I understand why there is no midgame switching since it would lead people to spend ages in changing their build Overwatch has a lot of hard counters especially with tanks At the start of the wave during the armoury period there is no issue with players being able to switch characters Then just give them all their money back to reload with Voting to surrender If you get 5 votes then the game should end counting as a loss Giving the other team to win If a full team is nt enjoying a game they should nt be forced to continue playing for several more rounds Voting should become available after completing 1 2 rounds If no one is having fun this will lead to players under performing due to lower morale If your team is nt trying then you are then fighting an uphill battle making the game less enjoyable Stadium is a long game mode so being forced to deal with this for an extended period can be quite frustrating What do you all think and what changes would you like to see,3 thing I think stadium could use my first suggestion be a save loadout tab like the example build another tab where you could set your own custombuild this would make it good to jump into practice range and save some custombuild for multiplayer my 2nd suggestion be allow Hero swap at the start of each round I understand why there be no midgame switching since it would lead people to spend age in change their build Overwatch have a lot of hard counter especially with tank at the start of the wave during the armoury period there be no issue with player be able to switch character then just give they all their money back to reload with voting to surrender if you get 5 vote then the game should end counting as a loss give the other team to win if a full team be not enjoy a game they should not be force to continue play for several more round voting should become available after complete 1 2 round if no one be have fun this will lead to player under perform due to low morale if your team be not try then you be then fight an uphill battle make the game less enjoyable Stadium be a long game mode so be force to deal with this for an extended period can be quite frustrating what do you all think and what change would you like to see,3 thing think stadium use suggestion save loadout tab like example build tab set custombuild good jump practice range save custombuild multiplayer 2nd suggestion allow Hero swap start round understand midgame switching lead people spend age change build Overwatch lot hard counter especially tank start wave armoury period issue player able switch character money reload voting surrender 5 vote game end counting loss team win team enjoy game force continue play round voting available complete 1 2 round fun lead player perform low morale team try fight uphill battle game enjoyable Stadium long game mode force deal extended period frustrating think change like

pattern matching brain always wants to find the perfect swap or adjustment if things are going sideways but theres way too much choice and diminishing returns in character swapping especially now with potentially being behind on perks in the late game Locking me into a character focuses all of my choice into the builds themselves which as I mentioned is my sweet spot Ive been able to contribute to reverse sweeps simply by locking into a solid build in the third round assuming no leavers 😔 Aim This may sound crazy but I strongly prefer 3rd person view because I have more information but also because having my big ol body in the middle of the screen helps me line up my shots like having a ruler on a piece of paper Beyond that I can compensate for my mechanical shortcomings with specific

decisions I made rather than lamenting my lack of pure skill Silliness The main reason Ive stuck with Overwatch over the years and not explored too much else really is the characters and overall vibe

Blizzard Season 16 Stadium AMA Full questionanswer list This is a LOT grab your chocolate milk and maybe take a few breaks during this long read Big thanks to all the devs for participating in this Original thread and discussion FireWizard312 Why add third person mode Have you found it to be a significant change in balancing and playing blizzDylan Weve talked about this a bit in interviews but Overwatch has always had thirdperson elements as part of its gameplay since it first launched Abilities like Reinhardt or Brigittes shield Junkrats tire etc where it made sense and players would benefit from the additional environmental context we used it As so much of Stadium focused on expanding and pushing hero fantasy often by making hero abilities more explosive or impactful we found that having a thirdperson option on all of the time was the best method to give players that extra peripheral information to cover these new sources of visual noise I actually have found that a full thirdperson mode hasnt impacted our balancing philosophy too much though there are of course growing pains associated with any move like this That said I personally enjoy using 3p almost exclusively as I find it really helps sell the feel were going for with Stadium Madrizzle1 How does the mostly positive feedback feel after working so hard to claw back fan trust blizzDylan I can only speak for myself but every step of our launch of Stadium from the reveal during Spotlight until now has been absolutely incredible and surreal In game development and indeed in most professional pursuits I think it can be very easy to be so close to something you lose sight of just how special or enjoyable your work is You can see every blemish or shortcoming or bit you still want to perfect but all the wonderful progress often gets harder and harder to see So seeing folks respond so positively to Stadium Season 16 and even Season 15 before this has been extremely energizing and an important reminder that hey most importantly the team made something fun Were beyond thrilled to have hit a point where we now get to collaborate with all of you to grow Stadium into something even greater FalconKick Similarly to Dylan I can only speak for myself too but I started at Blizzard on the Overwatch League in 2017 so you can imagine all of the ups and downs weve been through in 8 years since then Blizzard has been around for decades at this point Overwatch has been around for nearly 10 years itself there are literally generations of people who work here these days I am of a younger generation some on the Stadium team are of an older generation others are the next generation after me It is extremely validating and cathartic that after so many years and with so much change in Blizzard in Overwatch we can still put out something new and exciting that is hopefully true to what our fans want right now in 2025 We are all so happy yall are enjoying it kuryniyson Hello I have some questions about stadium 1 Is there any plan to introduce the stadium into custom games in the near future perhaps midseason or in the next season 2 Are there any plans to add consumable items such as healing kits or temporary buffs for characters similar to features seen in other comparable projects Additionally would you consider implementing items designed to counter specific characters I believe this could make build diversity more interesting and help players survive better against certain matchups blizzDylan We will have more to share soon but the short answer is we absolutely want to get custom games for Stadium up and running In regard to counterspecific items we have some in the game already as being able to counterbuild is a key part of Stadiums identity For example both Ashe and Junker Queen have items to help give them some sort of value out of having their Wound or Burn effects cleansed because those are core aspects of their kit identity Similarly DVA and Genji were given options to help them tackle beam attacks where they normally would not be able to directly interact with that matchup Well continue keeping an eye out for severe cases like those and items or Powers that address them are absolutely on the table LoudMouth73 If I remember correctly on the roadmap for the year under season 16 there was a map on the stadium part of the season which I think was either Kings Row or Midtown so I ask is there any plans to have the payload modes in clash or is that something that just cant really happen blizzDylan As you may have noticed in Stadium we have a mix of new and old maps that we felt fit the pace and mechanics we wanted to highlight in Stadium In one of those cases we have a Paris map which while it may have some thematic similarities to a classic Overwatch map is by and large made with brand new art and designed from scratch to fit the game mode it features Push We found that this was a great opportunity to take a fresh approach to locations from Overwatchs history and I would say dont be surprised if you see us do more of that in the future AlgernonFrost Thanks for taking the time to do an AMA and working on this new mode What are somethings you would like to share with the community that you normally would not be able to Bonus would you rather fight 1 horsesized duck or 100 ducksized horses blizzDylan Normally they would forbid me from saying this but now that my chains are broken and my personality truly unleashed I would like to share with the community that I think theyre super neat and I want them to have a great day Bonus 100 ducksized horses are just begging to be punted and I will not elaborate any further BlizzMegan So I see we have a Paris map and that just leads the ask HORIZON LUNAR COLONY MAP WHEN GUYS blizzDylan Winston Winston Winston Hammond squeak squeaksqueak squeaaaaak Robot Voice The hamster demands to know the answer as well novelgpa I love all the itempower names whats the process like for coming up with them Do you all just bounce names off each other until 1 sticks Is it challenging to translate them to different languages blizzDylan Really glad you like them The names have changed a lot over the development of the mode Early on many of them were very literal if an Power gave Juno another charge of Pulsar Torpedoes it was probably at one point called More Torpedoes or something along those lines This also made it easier to adapt our various documentation when we would change or swap different PowersItems and their effects dont ask Sadie how many times she was forced to redo icons because of this shell throw things at me In the most recent pass which is what we ended up shipping with I kept a fair number of the clever names our team had come up with over time there were lots of fun brainstorms over the years and then attempted to introduce a good balance of humor informative practicality and a sprinkling of fun lore nods where I could Conor also requested that we try to keep things like Items feeling suitably physical like theyre literal items that you could hold Powers could be a bit more nebulous a bit more conceptual less literal As far as translation goes we are super fortunate to have an incredible team of localization pros at Blizzard that work on all of our titles and they continue to crush it even as we hand them awful amazing puns Yes I came up with Twozu No I will not apologize Miennai Who are your favorite heroes to play in Stadium Favorite builds on those heroes blizzSadBoy Personally I love playing Ana I favor builds that increase her weapon power and allow her to fight on her own terms A lone wolf type of Ana which I feel suits her very well falconkick Im someone who loves experimenting so I intentionally try to go for builds that arent popular One really fun one I like to try is weapon power Juno with the Stinger power to start Stinger lets you get some really interesting early econ boost because youre involved in almost every kill BlizzKeville Im a little biased because I implemented these but I really enjoy taking Fleet Foot and Clone Conjuration on Kiriko and living out that ninja fantasy going for flank kills and assassinations blizztoby One hero in the main game that never clicked with me was Mei and once I tried the rolling ice block build on her in a playtest I was sold BlizzConorKouzy HybridAbility Power Genji is just too fun But Melee Genji also gives it a run for its money Ive also been known to terrorize some of our internal playtests on Charge Reinhardt Rumor has that the Charge build works 30 better if youve got the Conductor skin equipped slimshinoda Why there is new abilities like meis snowball while others like Cassidy dont have anything new only options to get better damage or cooldowns I really believe one big part of the fun is the new abilities instead of just overpowering current abilities blizzSadBoy Thats a great question and maybe something to keep in mind for the future though I keep suggesting that Cassidy should turn into a giant tumbleweed and mosey around but Dylan said no BlizzLarrypickle To provide some design insight on this one rough guideline we try to do is to have a couple flashy transformative powers per hero We dont always hit the mark on these though and sometimes during the iteration process we have to remove them due to gameplay issues so certain heroes have less They are the most expensive to develop from an art standpoint and require the most design iteration as well so no promises for now but we will be continuing to iterate on all heroes existing powers items RexLongbone What hero was the most challenging to design powers for blizzSadBoy Sadie On the art and UI side of things theres a few heroes that come to mind Our tankier heroes who have larger silhouettes need more space vs our DPSSupport heroes My personal demeion was Mei a lot of her abilities affect others so having to illustrate and convey ice was a challenge There also is a hero coming up in a future season that led to some explosive hurdles to jump JeffTek Thanks for the AMA Been an Overwatch enjoyer since launch and I am in love with Stadium yall are doing great My question Generally speaking would you say the Stadium dev team is more like a plate of lobster ravioli or a plate of miniature finger sandwiches made with Pimento cheese blizzSadBoy I think this is the hardest question to answer from this AMAI cant speak for every other person on the team but some days you feel like a lobster ravioli and other days you feel like a left out plate of miniature finger sandos you know LightScavenger Loving the mode so far My question is as follows when designing heroes for the mode do you generally prefer transformative powers that change hero fantasy or abilities that double down on existing hero strengths blizzSadBoy This is a really fantastic question thank you for asking While we do like to keep within each heros respective hero fantasy and design we also dont want to limit ourselves in any way Overall its dependent on each hero and their lorebackground For example our beloved Flying Rein feels like something hed absolutely do maybe he bugged Brigitte to enhance his suit or something But his character personality is exuberant over the top Whereas Reaper who also has a flying ability seems much more covert due to his wraith form And that ideology applies to our other heroes too Ana for example would look horribly out of place soaring through the air though as an Ana main I think that would be pretty sick RobManfredsFixer What successes and issues have you found with how the ranking system works Any solutions youre considering to improve the player experience Matchmaking adjustments surrender option etc Knowing its not the same as regular ranked I think part of it is that players need to temper their expectations but there are also some legitimate complaints as well BlizzShedrick I think the biggest success weve seen with the ranked system so far is how accessible it is We really wanted the funnel to be open as wide as possible to give everyone a chance to jump in and have fun right away For matchmaking in particular were always looking for ways to improve on the experience Because Stadium is a brand new mode the matchmaker hasnt had much of an opportunity to put players where they need to be yet That being said things will absolutely smooth out over time as people play more matches and settle into their ranks jookum Awesome mode Loved it since the first playtest and basically havent put it down Brawl seems to be the clear and obvious best way to play the game Do you think there are ways to evolve the game past just ramming your head at the other team or is it just a function of the current roster reaper rein etc Also are there plans for a toggle 1p3p button Navigating to settings isnt the worst but I wonder if a simple toggle keybind is possible BlizzShedrick Great question I think this largely comes down to which heroes you and your teammates pick Brawl can absolutely be a viable play style but it tends to leave you vulnerable to counterplay from heroes that have a strong flank game Ashe is a great example here if youre going up against a Rein that is building into shield health youre gonna have a really bad time staying in the back line and pouring ammo into a shield that will basically never break Instead taking an angle to try to pressure their supports can be a great way to either get picks or at least force their Rein to fall back to help I know I know we can all dream As for a 1p3p toggle this is not something that were currently planning on doing but that doesnt mean its entirely out of the question Were always looking for feedback from the community on what they want to see next and theres nothing stopping us from revisiting a feature if it garners enough interest Lubok Stadium matchmaking questions Is there an internal MMR that is not bound to visual rank If so was it seeded from other modes perhaps with a soft reset or is it full blank slate Will it be softhard reset for every season in Stadium Is matchmaking currently more similar to QP in terms of allowed MMR ranges in a match even without cosidering lack of grouping restrictions I see some amount of speculations and questions about that so would be cool to have something to refer to Thanks BlizzShedrick Q Is there an internal MMR that is not bound to visual rank A Yes we use an internal MMR for matchmaking that is independent of a players visual rank However we apply various bonuses such as calibration and win streak bonuses to help better align a players visual rank with their internal MMR Q If so was it seeded from other modes perhaps with a soft reset or is it a full blank slate A The internal MMR is a full blank slate with logic similar to that of competitive matches Q Will it be a soft or hard reset for every season in Stadium A Currently we plan to perform a soft reset of MMR at the start of each Stadium season Q Is matchmaking currently more similar to Quick Play in terms of allowed MMR ranges in a match even without considering the lack of grouping restrictions A Stadium matchmaking is more similar to competitive matchmaking than to Quick Play sinciety Hi big fan of stadium so far My one main issue with the mode is sometimes it feels like the team match ups can be a little oppressive ie dva into zarya although the beam defense buff did help or mei reaper in rein Is there any possibilities of a draft mode to help avoid hard counter compositions blizzduffin Hero bans are still a new system in Overwatch and we felt it would be too limiting with Stadiums current roster We may revisit Hero bans for Stadium in the future when the cast is much larger Thefrost Is there a reason why third person is over the shoulder instead of center behind the characters like Rein blizzduffin If characters are too centered it can block the reticle during certain abilities Were always working on improvements to the camera per hero and a centered camera fit better for Reinhardts kit Frostlark I believe Stadium to be inherently snowbally given the nature of the currency and build system Is this by design and is there any way to remedy this in the works It personally limits my enjoyment though I suppose I dont have any data to show this is true blizzduffin Asymmetrical power was always a part of the design The bounty system and boost system were both implemented to keep matches from being too snowbally Were reviewing feedback and ingame stats on how it is all working to see about any future adjustments Nothing to share at the moment Icedmanta Hi First off Id like to say just how much my friends and I have been enjoying this mode it goes beyond just a simple mode and feels like a whole new game How different has the development pipeline been from the standard base game dev team Have there been any unique challenges or considerations that people might not expect It seems like there are so many more moving parts compared to the regular game and Im wondering what it looks like on the other side of the glass blizzduffin Glad youre all enjoying it Thanks for sharing to your question While game development is always collaborative giant new features like Stadium are more of a group effort than normal Different teams have unique specializations and contribute to stadium on top of their regular work While there are devs dedicated to stadium like Dylan a large part of the team is still supporting the live game WHILE working on stadium An example would be some of the level designers are working on maps for both modes or artists splitting time depending on what has the need at that moment While there were many unexpected challenges one example of a challenge that gained complexity was the scoreboard It required performance optimization controller navigation social feature interaction lots of UI work and tooltips Many different engineers designers artists and analysts on different teams contributed to the success of that one feature Unlike some other flashier features when the scoreboard is working well nobody notices it RobManfredsFixer How will you prioritize which heroes will be added What kind of factors affect this Difficulty adapting them to the format Popularity of a given hero Considering you cant change heroes have you considered prioritizing popular one trick heroes blizzduffin The current plan is to add new heroes to stadium the mid season after they release For existing heroes there are many factors that determine which heroes enter the stadium While hero popularity is one gameplay is generally considered first Kind of like how DVA was introduced into Overwatch at the same time Mei was Its important to maintain healthy game balance when introducing new choices We hope to get everyone eventually but the live game isnt always the best measurement of who should be next because stadiums gameplay balance is very different from other live modes martinMayhem How do you feel about the fact that modern gaming communities often focus heavily on minmaxing With the influence of content creators forums and other resources its now incredibly easy to access broken builds rather than players experimenting and figuring things out for themselves Because stadium is currently competitive only theres a strong incentive to follow the path of least resistance which indirectly forces players to go with the flow and look up optimized builds rather than encouraging them to create weird goofy and less optimal ones falconkick Im glad you asked this question as I have some background on both sides of this Before I joined Blizzard I created these sorts of resources for the community and then after joining I have been creating the internal tools we use to stay ahead of this exact behavior As youve mentioned players have incredible resources to improve in all aspects of our games and thats without us really sharing much data at all In regular Overwatch as well these sorts of pressures to play optimally exist Our strategy generally has been to keep the game fresh with regular changes to combat this pressure and also fight against a feeling of staleness of play Even the most beloved metas in the past grew repetitive over time and we owed it to our players to shake the game up on a regular basis I believe there is a sweet spot of adjusting hero balance often enough that the game doesnt get stale but letting things stew long enough for players to master a given state of the game Ultimately most of the optimal builds comps or playstyles start off as goofy at one point or another and that part in a metas lifecycle is very important That being said its also very fun to play OP stuff But just not for too long Its a tricky line to walk Its up to us to keep things new fresh and changing often enough that that cycle of discovery and mastery is a constant in our game Were doing the best that we can and learning with every patch I will say though our internal tools do indicate that there is if not a goofy herobuild certainly a lesspopular hero that is winning quite handily that few players are playing relatively Lucio swarlesbarkley Can we expect any inspiration to be taken from stadium itemspowers and be used in future updates to perks in the main mode Or vice versa PS stadium is awesome Thanks for all that you do falconkick I may have pitched a stadium power as a major perk for a particular hero because I liked it so much and a version of it may be coming in the future but Im not sure I can say which one OwlLoverLivvy How does the balancing process for Stadium look compared to the rest of the game I imagine its a lot more complicated given that each character is basically 3 in 1 falconkick Hoo boy this is the big question isnt it Stadium adds many more layers of complexity to Overwatch than the base game has Economy bounties powers items a different ranked system tons and tons of depth of play In terms of just raw dashboard count I think we have 34x as many ways to look at balance for Stadium than for baseline Competitive As a nonexhaustive list of what were considering weve got Power win and pick rates Item win and pick rates Hero win and pick rates Item pick rates globally not considering hero Economy data where are players earning currency What are they spending it on Match outcome data how long are matches How often do comebacks occur What is the relationship between economy and outcomes And many many more The trickiest problem of them all is what to do with combinations of powers and items or Builds because there are an incredible amount of combinations available in Stadium but only a few of them might be required to comprise what we as players would define as a Build This is a unique problem to Stadium that the base game simply does not have At best we can make an educated guess about what a build might be before trying to roll up millions of matches worth of data to analyze its performance But that approach is far too manual dependent on individual subjectivity and doesnt scale when we need to rapidly make changes to Stadium to address balance concerns We needed a way to automate asking the right question what builds exist for this hero before performing analyses is this build performing well We do so by pretreating the data with cluster analyses on the heroes and their poweritem combinations which label the players and matches with labels like Build 1 or Build 2 such that they can be categorized defined and aggregated later We then use various methods power occurrence item occurrence ability keyword occurrence to describe the builds so that we can say things like Junker Queen Build 1 is a CarnageRampage build that tends to use the Thirsty for Blood item and be able to say that Junker Queen Build 1 has whatever Win Rate or Usage Rate This gives us deeper insight into whether an individual power or item is overpowered or if the combination of several powers and items not individual is what could be targets for nerfs or buffs VisionaireX This is an amazingly well thought out and transparent answer Thank you FalconKick anytime deafhaven Which heroes are most popular right now in Stadium falconkick Damage Soldier 76 is far out ahead of the rest however the rest of the cast are fairly close together Support Juno is mostpicked the rest are within 15 of her pick rate except for Lucio who is last by a fair margin hes very good though Tank Similarly to Soldier Reinhardt is a decent way ahead of the rest of the tanks but the rest of the tanks are very closely grouped in pick rate cyberdavi7 How lose falconkick I winnt A55MA5TER69 Do you have data that tracks which items and powers are the most popularhave the highest winrate for every hero Whether you do or not do you still plan to buff or nerf the powers that feel like outliers falconkick Short answer Yes Longer answer This sort of balancing tracking outliers on the high and low end is how we approach all of our design I wrote a little more information on that process in this post BlizzLarrypickle To add onto Bens answer data plays a big part in what we decide to buff nerf and we will be active in adjusting power outliers However player perception also plays a large part in what we decide to adjust and if something feels particularly difficult to counterplay or frustrating to play against we may adjust that sooner even if the data suggests its not an outlier The two usually do support each other but not always IAmBLD Whats the process for coming up with items and builds for a new hero like Were there maybe scrapped ideas for Freja during development that became powers later Do you plan for future new heroes to be fasttracked into Stadium BlizzLarryPickle Thanks for the question We usually start with a set of archetypes that hit on different fantasies or focus on a different part of the heros kit Usually we want one core fantasy build that typically empowers the core gameplay loop of that hero and then the other archetypes typically introduce new gameplay patterns or more transformative effects After we have a set of archetypes we usually want 23 core powers to support each of those archetypes and then the rest are filled out with more flexible powers that are applicable to a number of archetypes We did turn an early prototype for Frejas ultimate into a power I believe the current thinking is to prioritize getting new heroes into Stadium the midseason after theyre released falconkick Im not a designer but Larry has to deal with me invading his dms with all sorts of crackpot ideas Im awesome at terrible ideas so they just do the opposite of what I pitch beigemore At the end of a match will it ever be possible to show the best POTG from the entire match rather than just the POTG from the last round falconkick A play of play of the game the gameintriguing LinkRTX Wanted to know if there was any problems with animation while working on 3rd person view you say there was a lot of work hope to know if something funny was happening while doing all this And thank you for your amazing dedication and passion for Overwatch you are leading the game in the best direction it ever couldve taken blizzBruceW Something interesting here is we had to expand our current animation system to be able to deal with uniquely tuned VFX for the new 3rd person camera Sometimes an effect can look great in 1P due to the camera perspective but when viewing that same VFX in 3P it starts to not read correctly Our VFX team did a great job finding and dealing with a bunch of these felixw1 When is brigitte getting added blizzBruceW Ive offered to trade graphics features for getting Brigitte added #doingmypart Shaclo Is there any plans to add ways to generate money from mitigating damage On tank it feels really incentivised to play aggressive and not as supportive with shielding upgrades as you often end up behind the enemy tank which leads to unfun one sided games BlizzConorKouzy We do not have any plans to grant Stadium Cash from mitigating damage Currently our Stadium Cash generation from damage and healing matches closely to how Ultimate Charge or Perk experience gain works Part of the reason for this is that some heroes can mitigate infinite amounts of damage looking at you DVa Mitigating damage also prevents your opponents from generating Stadium Cash just like it does to Ultimate Charge so there is some important currency impact that occurs from damage mitigation Weve attempted to give every hero a tankierutility focused build path that players can pivot into when theyre falling behind This is paired with our Survival items generally being lower in price as intended to allow you to still be effective for your team even when youre not having your best game And this isnt just isolated to Tanks Im sure youve encountered a few tanky Reapers and Soldier76s out there FalconKick To add to Conors post we do track where players are earning currency generally from various sources and are keeping track of the rate of currency gain across various heroes and roles BlizzKeville I feel you on this one It was one of my first bits of feedback after we added damage and healing based currency that we should consider adding mitigation currency for this exact reason We even playtested with it for a while Another reason behind the decision in addition to the ones Conor mentioned was that it just sort of felt bad to know that any time you broke Reins shield you just gave him a ton of money It was almost like an infinite duration Zarya bubble where they kept the power in between rounds Icedmanta Hi First off Id like to say just how much my friends and I have been enjoying this mode it goes beyond just a simple mode and feels like a whole new game How different has the development pipeline been from the standard base game dev team Have there been any unique challenges or considerations that people might not expect It seems like there are so many more moving parts compared to the regular game and Im wondering what it looks like on the other side of the glass BlizzKeville First off so happy to hear how much fun you and your friends are having This is amazing to hear One thing people might not expect is just how many different iterations Stadium went through on its journey to launch You can see a little bit of this by comparing Stadium to Junkensteins Lab whose random nature more closely resembled what we were considering shipping Stadium with at the time When making something that you want to feel like a whole new experience there really isnt any better way than to try something new play it yourself see if its fun and keep trying until it is Which can take a long time After many attempts at this were so excited about how Stadium turned out and the reception its getting from players like yourself CertainDerision33 Since Stadium does not have swapping how does the team think about design with adding heroes like Pharah or Ball who in regular play often demand swapping in order to effectively interact with them Loving Stadium so far Keep up the great work BlizzConorKouzy In Stadium we are always striving for players to feel like they have the tools to pick from to adapt to their opponents We have tried to create Hero Items that help soften some of the worst matchups We also try to create answers in the general items For example if youre struggling with beam heroes weve got a lot of ways to get Armor to reduce a significant amount of that damage Additionally we also try to create builds and powers that are stronger in certain hero matchups Ultimately were trying to create an experience where you feel like you can play the hero you chose in any matchup even if youre at a slight disadvantage We know weve not perfectly hit that mark just yet We will continue to try to add the answers every hero needs As we continue to add more heroes to Stadium we will also update previous heroes to make sure they have the tools needed to combat the newly added heroes BlizzKeville Expanding on Conors answer one of the core goals of Stadiums design is that we empower you to replace counter swapping with counter building An example of the kind of upgrade weve made for this is Genjis AntiBeam Coating which you can buy in those ZaryaMeiMoira games that ordinarily make you feel like you have to swap off To your point though we do have our design work cut out for us with Pharah and Ball which is part of why we decided not to include them in the launch roster Cant speak to any specifics yet but were certainly talking about ways we can address these matchups too and make them fun TechnicalAd2963 Loving Stadium Have you guys explored customized presaved load outs Similar to the prebuilds the heroes already have my friends and I like to use the same powers and would think it would be a nice quality of life to have 1 pr,Blizzard Season 16 Stadium AMA Full questionanswer list This is a LOT grab your chocolate milk and maybe take a few breaks during this long read Big thanks to all the devs for participating in this Original thread and discussion FireWizard312 Why add third person mode Have you found it to be a significant change in balancing and playing blizzDylan We ve talked about this a bit in interviews but Overwatch has always had thirdperson elements as part of its gameplay since it first launched Abilities like Reinhardt or Brigittes shield Junkrats tire etc where it made sense and players would benefit from the additional environmental context we used it As so much of Stadium focused on expanding and pushing hero fantasy often by making hero abilities more explosive or impactful we found that having a thirdperson option on all of the time was the best method to give players that extra peripheral information to cover these new sources of visual noise I actually have found that a full thirdperson mode has nt impacted our balancing philosophy too much though there are of course growing pains associated with any move like this That said I personally enjoy using 3p almost exclusively as I find it really helps sell the feel were going for with Stadium Madrizzle1 How does the mostly positive feedback feel after working so hard to claw back fan trust blizzDylan I can only speak for myself but every step of our launch of Stadium from the reveal during Spotlight until now has been absolutely incredible and surreal In game development and indeed in most professional pursuits I think it can be very easy to be so close to something you lose sight of just how special or enjoyable your work is You can see every blemish or shortcoming or bit you still want to perfect but all the wonderful progress often gets harder and harder to see So seeing folks respond so positively to Stadium Season 16 and even Season 15 before this has been extremely energizing and an important reminder that hey most importantly the team made something fun Were beyond thrilled to have hit a point where we now get to collaborate with all of you to grow Stadium into something even greater FalconKick Similarly to Dylan I can only speak for myself too but I started at Blizzard on the Overwatch League in 2017 so you can imagine all of the ups and downs we ve been through in 8 years since then Blizzard has been around for decades at this point Overwatch has been around for nearly 10 years itself there are literally generations of people who work here these days I am of a younger generation some on the Stadium team are of an older generation others are the next generation after me It is extremely validating and cathartic that after so many years and with so much change in Blizzard in Overwatch we can still put out something new and exciting that is hopefully true to what our fans want right now in 2025 We are all so happy y all are enjoying it kuryniyson Hello I have some questions about stadium 1 Is there any plan to introduce the stadium into custom games in the near future perhaps midseason or in the next season 2 Are there any plans to add consumable items such as healing kits or temporary buffs for characters similar to features seen in other comparable projects Additionally would you consider implementing items designed to counter specific characters I believe this could make build diversity more interesting and help players survive better against certain matchups blizzDylan We will have more to share soon but the short answer is we absolutely want to get custom games for Stadium up and running In regard to counterspecific items we have some in the game already as being able to counterbuild is a key part of Stadiums identity For example both Ashe and Junker Queen have items to help give them some sort of value out of having their Wound or Burn effects cleansed because those are core aspects of their kit identity Similarly DVA and Genji were given options to help them tackle beam attacks where they normally would not be able to directly interact with that matchup Well continue keeping an eye out for severe cases like those and items or Powers that address them are absolutely on the table LoudMouth73 If I remember correctly on the roadmap for the year under season 16 there was a map on the stadium part of the season which I think was either Kings Row or Midtown so I ask is there any plans to have the payload modes in clash or is that something that just ca nt really happen blizzDylan As you may have noticed in Stadium we have a mix of new and old maps that we felt fit the pace and mechanics we wanted to highlight in Stadium In one of those cases we have a Paris map which while it may have some thematic similarities to a classic Overwatch map is by and large made with brand new art and designed from scratch to fit the game mode it features Push We found that this was a great opportunity to take a fresh approach to locations from Overwatchs history and I would say do nt be surprised if you see us do more of that in the future AlgernonFrost Thanks for taking the time to do an AMA and working on this new mode What are somethings you would like to share with the community that you normally would not be able to Bonus would you rather fight 1 horsesized duck or 100 ducksized horses blizzDylan Normally they would forbid me from saying this but now that my chains are broken and my personality truly unleashed I would like to share with the community that I think they re super neat and I want them to have a great day Bonus 100 ducksized horses are just begging to be punted and I will not elaborate any further BlizzMegan So I see we have a Paris map and that just leads the ask HORIZON LUNAR COLONY MAP WHEN GUYS blizzDylan Winston Winston Winston Hammond squeak squeaksqueak squeaaaaak Robot Voice The hamster demands to know the answer as well novelgpa I love all the itempower names what s the process like for coming up with them Do you all just bounce names off each other until 1 sticks Is it challenging to translate them to different languages blizzDylan Really glad you like them The names have changed a lot over the development of the mode Early on many of them were very literal if an Power gave Juno another charge of Pulsar Torpedoes it was probably at one point called More Torpedoes or something along those lines This also made it easier to adapt our various documentation when we would change or swap different PowersItems and their effects do nt ask Sadie how many times she was forced to redo icons because of this shell throw things at me In the most recent pass which is what we ended up shipping with I kept a fair number of the clever names our team had come up with over time there were lots of fun brainstorms over the years and then attempted to introduce a good balance of humor informative practicality and a sprinkling of fun lore nods where I could Conor also requested that we try to keep things like Items feeling suitably physical like they re literal items that you could hold Powers could be a bit more nebulous a bit more conceptual less literal As far as translation goes we are super fortunate to have an incredible team of localization pros at Blizzard that work on all of our titles and they continue to crush it even as we hand them awful amazing puns Yes I came up with Twozu No I will not apologize Miennai Who are your favorite heroes to play in Stadium Favorite builds on those heroes blizzSadBoy Personally I love playing Ana I favor builds that increase her weapon power and allow her to fight on her own terms A lone wolf type of Ana which I feel suits her very well falconkick I m someone who loves experimenting so I intentionally try to go for builds that are nt popular One really fun one I like to try is weapon power Juno with the Stinger power to start Stinger lets you get some really interesting early econ boost because you re involved in almost every kill BlizzKeville I m a little biased because I implemented these but I really enjoy taking Fleet Foot and Clone Conjuration on Kiriko and living out that ninja fantasy going for flank kills and assassinations blizztoby One hero in the main game that never clicked with me was Mei and once I tried the rolling ice block build on her in a playtest I was sold BlizzConorKouzy HybridAbility Power Genji is just too fun But Melee Genji also gives it a run for its money I ve also been known to terrorize some of our internal playtests on Charge Reinhardt Rumor has that the Charge build works 30 better if you ve got the Conductor skin equipped slimshinoda Why there is new abilities like meis snowball while others like Cassidy do nt have anything new only options to get better damage or cooldowns I really believe one big part of the fun is the new abilities instead of just overpowering current abilities blizzSadBoy That s a great question and maybe something to keep in mind for the future though I keep suggesting that Cassidy should turn into a giant tumbleweed and mosey around but Dylan said no BlizzLarrypickle To provide some design insight on this one rough guideline we try to do is to have a couple flashy transformative powers per hero We do nt always hit the mark on these though and sometimes during the iteration process we have to remove them due to gameplay issues so certain heroes have less They are the most expensive to develop from an art standpoint and require the most design iteration as well so no promises for now but we will be continuing to iterate on all heroes existing powers items RexLongbone What hero was the most challenging to design powers for blizzSadBoy Sadie On the art and UI side of things there s a few heroes that come to mind Our tankier heroes who have larger silhouettes need more space vs our DPSSupport heroes My personal demeion was Mei a lot of her abilities affect others so having to illustrate and convey ice was a challenge There also is a hero coming up in a future season that led to some explosive hurdles to jump JeffTek Thanks for the AMA Been an Overwatch enjoyer since launch and I am in love with Stadium y all are doing great My question Generally speaking would you say the Stadium dev team is more like a plate of lobster ravioli or a plate of miniature finger sandwiches made with Pimento cheese blizzSadBoy I think this is the hardest question to answer from this AMAI ca nt speak for every other person on the team but some days you feel like a lobster ravioli and other days you feel like a left out plate of miniature finger sandos you know LightScavenger Loving the mode so far My question is as follows when designing heroes for the mode do you generally prefer transformative powers that change hero fantasy or abilities that double down on existing hero strengths blizzSadBoy This is a really fantastic question thank you for asking While we do like to keep within each heros respective hero fantasy and design we also do nt want to limit ourselves in any way Overall its dependent on each hero and their lorebackground For example our beloved Flying Rein feels like something he d absolutely do maybe he bugged Brigitte to enhance his suit or something But his character personality is exuberant over the top Whereas Reaper who also has a flying ability seems much more covert due to his wraith form And that ideology applies to our other heroes too Ana for example would look horribly out of place soaring through the air though as an Ana main I think that would be pretty sick RobManfredsFixer What successes and issues have you found with how the ranking system works Any solutions you re considering to improve the player experience Matchmaking adjustments surrender option etc Knowing its not the same as regular ranked I think part of it is that players need to temper their expectations but there are also some legitimate complaints as well BlizzShedrick I think the biggest success we ve seen with the ranked system so far is how accessible it is We really wanted the funnel to be open as wide as possible to give everyone a chance to jump in and have fun right away For matchmaking in particular were always looking for ways to improve on the experience Because Stadium is a brand new mode the matchmaker has nt had much of an opportunity to put players where they need to be yet That being said things will absolutely smooth out over time as people play more matches and settle into their ranks jookum Awesome mode Loved it since the first playtest and basically have nt put it down Brawl seems to be the clear and obvious best way to play the game Do you think there are ways to evolve the game past just ramming your head at the other team or is it just a function of the current roster reaper rein etc Also are there plans for a toggle 1p3p button Navigating to settings is nt the worst but I wonder if a simple toggle keybind is possible BlizzShedrick Great question I think this largely comes down to which heroes you and your teammates pick Brawl can absolutely be a viable play style but it tends to leave you vulnerable to counterplay from heroes that have a strong flank game Ashe is a great example here if you re going up against a Rein that is building into shield health you re gon na have a really bad time staying in the back line and pouring ammo into a shield that will basically never break Instead taking an angle to try to pressure their supports can be a great way to either get picks or at least force their Rein to fall back to help I know I know we can all dream As for a 1p3p toggle this is not something that were currently planning on doing but that does nt mean its entirely out of the question Were always looking for feedback from the community on what they want to see next and there s nothing stopping us from revisiting a feature if it garners enough interest Lubok Stadium matchmaking questions Is there an internal MMR that is not bound to visual rank If so was it seeded from other modes perhaps with a soft reset or is it full blank slate Will it be softhard reset for every season in Stadium Is matchmaking currently more similar to QP in terms of allowed MMR ranges in a match even without cosidering lack of grouping restrictions I see some amount of speculations and questions about that so would be cool to have something to refer to Thanks BlizzShedrick Q Is there an internal MMR that is not bound to visual rank A Yes we use an internal MMR for matchmaking that is independent of a players visual rank However we apply various bonuses such as calibration and win streak bonuses to help better align a players visual rank with their internal MMR Q If so was it seeded from other modes perhaps with a soft reset or is it a full blank slate A The internal MMR is a full blank slate with logic similar to that of competitive matches Q Will it be a soft or hard reset for every season in Stadium A Currently we plan to perform a soft reset of MMR at the start of each Stadium season Q Is matchmaking currently more similar to Quick Play in terms of allowed MMR ranges in a match even without considering the lack of grouping restrictions A Stadium matchmaking is more similar to competitive matchmaking than to Quick Play sinciety Hi big fan of stadium so far My one main issue with the mode is sometimes it feels like the team match ups can be a little oppressive ie dva into zarya although the beam defense buff did help or mei reaper in rein Is there any possibilities of a draft mode to help avoid hard counter compositions blizzduffin Hero bans are still a new system in Overwatch and we felt it would be too limiting with Stadiums current roster We may revisit Hero bans for Stadium in the future when the cast is much larger Thefrost Is there a reason why third person is over the shoulder instead of center behind the characters like Rein blizzduffin If characters are too centered it can block the reticle during certain abilities Were always working on improvements to the camera per hero and a centered camera fit better for Reinhardts kit Frostlark I believe Stadium to be inherently snowbally given the nature of the currency and build system Is this by design and is there any way to remedy this in the works It personally limits my enjoyment though I suppose I do nt have any data to show this is true blizzduffin Asymmetrical power was always a part of the design The bounty system and boost system were both implemented to keep matches from being too snowbally Were reviewing feedback and ingame stats on how it is all working to see about any future adjustments Nothing to share at the moment Icedmanta Hi First off I d like to say just how much my friends and I have been enjoying this mode it goes beyond just a simple mode and feels like a whole new game How different has the development pipeline been from the standard base game dev team Have there been any unique challenges or considerations that people might not expect It seems like there are so many more moving parts compared to the regular game and I m wondering what it looks like on the other side of the glass blizzduffin Glad you re all enjoying it Thanks for sharing to your question While game development is always collaborative giant new features like Stadium are more of a group effort than normal Different teams have unique specializations and contribute to stadium on top of their regular work While there are devs dedicated to stadium like Dylan a large part of the team is still supporting the live game WHILE working on stadium An example would be some of the level designers are working on maps for both modes or artists splitting time depending on what has the need at that moment While there were many unexpected challenges one example of a challenge that gained complexity was the scoreboard It required performance optimization controller navigation social feature interaction lots of UI work and tooltips Many different engineers designers artists and analysts on different teams contributed to the success of that one feature Unlike some other flashier features when the scoreboard is working well nobody notices it RobManfredsFixer How will you prioritize which heroes will be added What kind of factors affect this Difficulty adapting them to the format Popularity of a given hero Considering you ca nt change heroes have you considered prioritizing popular one trick heroes blizzduffin The current plan is to add new heroes to stadium the mid season after they release For existing heroes there are many factors that determine which heroes enter the stadium While hero popularity is one gameplay is generally considered first Kind of like how DVA was introduced into Overwatch at the same time Mei was Its important to maintain healthy game balance when introducing new choices We hope to get everyone eventually but the live game is nt always the best measurement of who should be next because stadiums gameplay balance is very different from other live modes martinMayhem How do you feel about the fact that modern gaming communities often focus heavily on minmaxing With the influence of content creators forums and other resources its now incredibly easy to access broken builds rather than players experimenting and figuring things out for themselves Because stadium is currently competitive only there s a strong incentive to follow the path of least resistance which indirectly forces players to go with the flow and look up optimized builds rather than encouraging them to create weird goofy and less optimal ones falconkick I m glad you asked this question as I have some background on both sides of this Before I joined Blizzard I created these sorts of resources for the community and then after joining I have been creating the internal tools we use to stay ahead of this exact behavior As you ve mentioned players have incredible resources to improve in all aspects of our games and that s without us really sharing much data at all In regular Overwatch as well these sorts of pressures to play optimally exist Our strategy generally has been to keep the game fresh with regular changes to combat this pressure and also fight against a feeling of staleness of play Even the most beloved metas in the past grew repetitive over time and we owed it to our players to shake the game up on a regular basis I believe there is a sweet spot of adjusting hero balance often enough that the game does nt get stale but letting things stew long enough for players to master a given state of the game Ultimately most of the optimal builds comps or playstyles start off as goofy at one point or another and that part in a metas lifecycle is very important That being said its also very fun to play OP stuff But just not for too long Its a tricky line to walk Its up to us to keep things new fresh and changing often enough that that cycle of discovery and mastery is a constant in our game Were doing the best that we can and learning with every patch I will say though our internal tools do indicate that there is if not a goofy herobuild certainly a lesspopular hero that is winning quite handily that few players are playing relatively Lucio swarlesbarkley Can we expect any inspiration to be taken from stadium itemspowers and be used in future updates to perks in the main mode Or vice versa PS stadium is awesome Thanks for all that you do falconkick I may have pitched a stadium power as a major perk for a particular hero because I liked it so much and a version of it may be coming in the future but I m not sure I can say which one OwlLoverLivvy How does the balancing process for Stadium look compared to the rest of the game I imagine its a lot more complicated given that each character is basically 3 in 1 falconkick Hoo boy this is the big question is nt it Stadium adds many more layers of complexity to Overwatch than the base game has Economy bounties powers items a different ranked system tons and tons of depth of play In terms of just raw dashboard count I think we have 34x as many ways to look at balance for Stadium than for baseline Competitive As a nonexhaustive list of what were considering we ve got Power win and pick rates Item win and pick rates Hero win and pick rates Item pick rates globally not considering hero Economy data where are players earning currency What are they spending it on Match outcome data how long are matches How often do comebacks occur What is the relationship between economy and outcomes And many many more The trickiest problem of them all is what to do with combinations of powers and items or Builds because there are an incredible amount of combinations available in Stadium but only a few of them might be required to comprise what we as players would define as a Build This is a unique problem to Stadium that the base game simply does not have At best we can make an educated guess about what a build might be before trying to roll up millions of matches worth of data to analyze its performance But that approach is far too manual dependent on individual subjectivity and does nt scale when we need to rapidly make changes to Stadium to address balance concerns We needed a way to automate asking the right question what builds exist for this hero before performing analyses is this build performing well We do so by pretreating the data with cluster analyses on the heroes and their poweritem combinations which label the players and matches with labels like Build 1 or Build 2 such that they can be categorized defined and aggregated later We then use various methods power occurrence item occurrence ability keyword occurrence to describe the builds so that we can say things like Junker Queen Build 1 is a CarnageRampage build that tends to use the Thirsty for Blood item and be able to say that Junker Queen Build 1 has whatever Win Rate or Usage Rate This gives us deeper insight into whether an individual power or item is overpowered or if the combination of several powers and items not individual is what could be targets for nerfs or buffs VisionaireX This is an amazingly well thought out and transparent answer Thank you FalconKick anytime deafhaven Which heroes are most popular right now in Stadium falconkick Damage Soldier 76 is far out ahead of the rest however the rest of the cast are fairly close together Support Juno is mostpicked the rest are within 15 of her pick rate except for Lucio who is last by a fair margin he s very good though Tank Similarly to Soldier Reinhardt is a decent way ahead of the rest of the tanks but the rest of the tanks are very closely grouped in pick rate cyberdavi7 How lose falconkick I winnt A55MA5TER69 Do you have data that tracks which items and powers are the most popularhave the highest winrate for every hero Whether you do or not do you still plan to buff or nerf the powers that feel like outliers falconkick Short answer Yes Longer answer This sort of balancing tracking outliers on the high and low end is how we approach all of our design I wrote a little more information on that process in this post BlizzLarrypickle To add onto Bens answer data plays a big part in what we decide to buff nerf and we will be active in adjusting power outliers However player perception also plays a large part in what we decide to adjust and if something feels particularly difficult to counterplay or frustrating to play against we may adjust that sooner even if the data suggests its not an outlier The two usually do support each other but not always IAmBLD What s the process for coming up with items and builds for a new hero like Were there maybe scrapped ideas for Freja during development that became powers later Do you plan for future new heroes to be fasttracked into Stadium BlizzLarryPickle Thanks for the question We usually start with a set of archetypes that hit on different fantasies or focus on a different part of the heros kit Usually we want one core fantasy build that typically empowers the core gameplay loop of that hero and then the other archetypes typically introduce new gameplay patterns or more transformative effects After we have a set of archetypes we usually want 23 core powers to support each of those archetypes and then the rest are filled out with more flexible powers that are applicable to a number of archetypes We did turn an early prototype for Frejas ultimate into a power I believe the current thinking is to prioritize getting new heroes into Stadium the midseason after they re released falconkick I m not a designer but Larry has to deal with me invading his dms with all sorts of crackpot ideas I m awesome at terrible ideas so they just do the opposite of what I pitch beigemore At the end of a match will it ever be possible to show the best POTG from the entire match rather than just the POTG from the last round falconkick A play of play of the game the gameintriguing LinkRTX Wanted to know if there was any problems with animation while working on 3rd person view you say there was a lot of work hope to know if something funny was happening while doing all this And thank you for your amazing dedication and passion for Overwatch you are leading the game in the best direction it ever could ve taken blizzBruceW Something interesting here is we had to expand our current animation system to be able to deal with uniquely tuned VFX for the new 3rd person camera Sometimes an effect can look great in 1P due to the camera perspective but when viewing that same VFX in 3P it starts to not read correctly Our VFX team did a great job finding and dealing with a bunch of these felixw1 When is brigitte getting added blizzBruceW I ve offered to trade graphics features for getting Brigitte added doingmypart Shaclo Is there any plans to add ways to generate money from mitigating damage On tank it feels really incentivised to play aggressive and not as supportive with shielding upgrades as you often end up behind the enemy tank which leads to unfun one sided games BlizzConorKouzy We do not have any plans to grant Stadium Cash from mitigating damage Currently our Stadium Cash generation from damage and healing matches closely to how Ultimate Charge or Perk experience gain works Part of the reason for this is that some heroes can mitigate infinite amounts of damage looking at you DVa Mitigating damage also prevents your opponents from generating Stadium Cash just like it does to Ultimate Charge so there is some important currency impact that occurs from damage mitigation We ve attempted to give every hero a tankierutility focused build path that players can pivot into when they re falling behind This is paired with our Survival items generally being lower in price as intended to allow you to still be effective for your team even when you re not having your best game And this is nt just isolated to Tanks I m sure you ve encountered a few tanky Reapers and Soldier76s out there FalconKick To add to Conors post we do track where players are earning currency generally from various sources and are keeping track of the rate of currency gain across various heroes and roles BlizzKeville I feel you on this one It was one of my first bits of feedback after we added damage and healing based currency that we should consider adding mitigation currency for this exact reason We even playtested with it for a while Another reason behind the decision in addition to the ones Conor mentioned was that it just sort of felt bad to know that any time you broke Reins shield you just gave him a ton of money It was almost like an infinite duration Zarya bubble where they kept the power in between rounds Icedmanta Hi First off I d like to say just how much my friends and I have been enjoying this mode it goes beyond just a simple mode and feels like a whole new game How different has the development

the regular game and I m wondering what it looks like on the other side of the glass BlizzKeville First off so happy to hear how much fun you and your friends are having This is amazing to hear One thing people might not expect is just how many different iterations Stadium went through on its journey to launch You can see a little bit of this by comparing Stadium to Junkensteins Lab whose random nature more closely resembled what we were considering shipping Stadium with at the time When making something that you want to feel like a whole new experience there really is nt any better way than to try something new play it yourself see if its fun and keep trying until it is Which can take a long time After many attempts at this were so excited about how Stadium turned out and the reception its getting from players like yourself CertainDerision33 Since Stadium does not have swapping how does the team think about design with adding heroes like Pharah or Ball who in regular play often

more of that in the future AlgernonFrost thank for take the time to do an AMA and work on this new mode what be something you would like to share with the community that you normally would not be able to Bonus would you rather fight 1 horsesized duck or 100 ducksize horse blizzdylan normally they would forbid I from say this but now that my chain be break and my personality truly unleashed I would like to share with the community that I think they re super neat and I want they to have a great day Bonus 100 ducksize horse be just beg to be punt and I will not elaborate any furth BlizzMegan so I see we have a Paris map and that just lead the ask HORIZON LUNAR colony MAP when GUYS blizzdylan Winston Winston Winston Hammond squeak squeaksqueak squeaaaaak Robot Voice the hamster demand to know the answer as well novelgpa I love all the itempower name what s the process like for come up with they do you all just bounce name off each other until 1 stick be it challenging to translate they to different language blizzdylan really glad you like they the name have change a lot over the development of the mode early on many of they be very literal if an power give Juno another charge of Pulsar Torpedoes it be probably at one point call More Torpedoes or something along those line this also make it easy to adapt our various documentation when we would change or swap different PowersItems and their effect do not ask Sadie how many time she be force to redo icon because of this shell throw thing at I in the most recent pass which be what we end up ship with I keep a fair number of the clever name our team have come up with over time there be lot of fun brainstorm over the year and then attempt to introduce a good balance of humor informative practicality and a sprinkling of fun lore nod where I could Conor also request that we try to keep thing like item feel suitably physical like they re literal item that you could hold Powers could be a bit more nebulous a bit more conceptual less literal as far as translation go we be super fortunate to have an incredible team of localization pro at Blizzard that work on all of our title and they continue to crush it even as we hand they awful amazing pun yes I come up with Twozu no I will not apologize Miennai who be your favorite hero to play in Stadium Favorite build on those hero blizzsadboy personally I love play Ana I favor build that increase her weapon power and allow she to fight on her own term a lone wolf type of Ana which I feel suit she very well falconkick I m someone who love experiment so I intentionally try to go for build that be not popular one really fun one I like to try be weapon power Juno with the Stinger power to start Stinger let you get some really interesting early econ boost because you re involve in almost every kill BlizzKeville I m a little biased because I implement these but I really enjoy take Fleet Foot and Clone Conjuration on Kiriko and live out that ninja fantasy go for flank kill and assassination blizztoby one hero in the main game that never click with I be Mei and once I try the roll ice block build on she in a playt I be sell BlizzConorKouzy HybridAbility Power Genji be just too fun but Melee Genji also give it a run for its money I ve also be know to terrorize some of our internal playtest on Charge Reinhardt Rumor have that the Charge build work 30 well if you ve get the Conductor skin equip slimshinoda why there be new ability like meis snowball while other like Cassidy do not have anything new only option to get well damage or cooldown I really believe one big part of the fun be the new ability instead of just overpower current ability blizzSadBoy that s a great question and maybe something to keep in mind for the future though I keep suggest that Cassidy should turn into a giant tumbleweed and mosey around but Dylan say no BlizzLarrypickle to provide some design insight on this one rough guideline we try to do be to have a couple flashy transformative power per hero we do not always hit the mark on these though and sometimes during the iteration process we have to remove they due to gameplay issue so certain hero have less they be the most expensive to develop from an art standpoint and require the most design iteration as well so no promise for now but we will be continue to iterate on all hero exist power item RexLongbone what hero be the most challenging to design power for blizzSadBoy Sadie on the art and UI side of thing there s a few hero that come to mind our tankier hero who have large silhouette need more space vs our DPSSupport hero my personal demeion be Mei a lot of her ability affect other so have to illustrate and convey ice be a challenge there also be a hero come up in a future season that lead to some explosive hurdle to jump JeffTek thank for the AMA be an Overwatch enjoyer since launch and I be in love with Stadium you all be do great my question generally speak would you say the Stadium dev team be more like a plate of lobster ravioli or a plate of miniature finger sandwich make with Pimento cheese blizzsadboy I think this be the hard question to answer from this amai can not speak for every other person on the team but some day you feel like a lobster ravioli and other day you feel like a leave out plate of miniature finger sando you know LightScavenger Loving the mode so far my question be as follow when design hero for the mode do you generally prefer transformative power that change hero fantasy or ability that double down on exist hero strength blizzsadboy this be a really fantastic question thank you for ask while we do like to keep within each heros respective hero fantasy and design we also do not want to limit ourselves in any way overall its dependent on each hero and their lorebackground for example our beloved Flying Rein feel like something he d absolutely do maybe he bug Brigitte to enhance his suit or something but his character personality be exuberant over the top Whereas Reaper who also have a fly ability seem much more covert due to his wraith form and that ideology apply to our other hero too Ana for example would look horribly out of place soar through the air though as an Ana main I think that would be pretty sick robmanfredsfixer what success and issue have you find with how the ranking system work any solution you re consider to improve the player experience matchmaking adjustment surrender option etc know its not the same as regular rank I think part of it be that player need to temper their expectation but there be also some legitimate complaint as well BlizzShedrick I think the big success we ve see with the rank system so far be how accessible it be we really want the funnel to be open as wide as possible to give everyone a chance to jump in and have fun right away for matchmaking in particular be always look for way to improve on the experience because Stadium be a brand new mode the matchmaker have not have much of an opportunity to put player where they need to be yet that be say thing will absolutely smooth out over time as people play more match and settle into their rank jookum Awesome mode love it since the first playt and basically have not put it down Brawl seem to be the clear and obvious good way to play the game do you think there be way to evolve the game past just ram your head at the other team or be it just a function of the current roster reaper rein etc also be there plan for a toggle 1p3p button navigate to setting be not the bad but I wonder if a simple toggle keybind be possible BlizzShedrick Great question I think this largely come down to which heroe you and your teammate pick Brawl can absolutely be a viable play style but it tend to leave you vulnerable to counterplay from hero that have a strong flank game Ashe be a great example here if you re go up against a rein that be build into shield health you re go to have a really bad time stay in the back line and pour ammo into a shield that will basically never break instead take an angle to try to pressure their support can be a great way to either get pick or at least force their rein to fall back to help I know I know we can all dream as for a 1p3p toggle this be not something that be currently plan on do but that do not mean its entirely out of the question be always look for feedback from the community on what they want to see next and there s nothing stop we from revisit a feature if it garner enough interest Lubok Stadium matchmaking question be there an internal MMR that be not bind to visual rank if so be it seed from other mode perhaps with a soft reset or be it full blank slate will it be softhard reset for every season in Stadium be matchmake currently more similar to QP in term of allow MMR range in a match even without cosidere lack of group restriction I see some amount of speculation and question about that so would be cool to have something to refer to thank BlizzShedrick Q be there an internal MMR that be not bind to visual rank a yes we use an internal MMR for matchmaking that be independent of a player visual rank however we apply various bonus such as calibration and win streak bonus to help well align a player visual rank with their internal MMR Q if so be it seed from other mode perhaps with a soft reset or be it a full blank slate a the internal MMR be a full blank slate with logic similar to that of competitive match Q will it be a soft or hard reset for every season in Stadium A currently we plan to perform a soft reset of MMR at the start of each Stadium season q be matchmake currently more similar to Quick Play in term of allow MMR range in a match even without consider the lack of group restriction a Stadium matchmaking be more similar to competitive matchmaking than to Quick play sinciety hi big fan of stadium so far my one main issue with the mode be sometimes it feel like the team match up can be a little oppressive ie dva into zarya although the beam defense buff do help or mei reaper in rein be there any possibility of a draft mode to help avoid hard counter composition blizzduffin Hero ban be still a new system in Overwatch and we feel it would be too limit with Stadiums current roster we may revisit Hero ban for Stadium in the future when the cast be much large thefrost be there a reason why third person be over the shoulder instead of center behind the character like Rein blizzduffin if character be too center it can block the reticle during certain ability be always work on improvement to the camera per hero and a center camera fit well for reinhardts kit Frostlark I believe Stadium to be inherently snowbally give the nature of the currency and build system be this by design and be there any way to remedy this in the work it personally limit my enjoyment though I suppose I do not have any datum to show this be true blizzduffin asymmetrical power be always a part of the design the bounty system and boost system be both implement to keep match from be too snowbally be review feedback and ingame stat on how it be all work to see about any future adjustment nothing to share at the moment Icedmanta hi first off I d like to say just how much my friend and I have be enjoy this mode it go beyond just a simple mode and feel like a whole new game how different have the development pipeline be from the standard base game dev team have there be any unique challenge or consideration that people might not expect it seem like there be so many more move part compare to the regular game and I m wonder what it look like on the other side of the glass blizzduffin Glad you re all enjoy it thank for share to your question while game development be always collaborative giant new feature like Stadium be more of a group effort than normal different team have unique specialization and contribute to stadium on top of their regular work while there be devs dedicated to stadium like Dylan a large part of the team be still support the live game while work on stadium an example would be some of the level designer be work on map for both mode or artist split time depend on what have the need at that moment while there be many unexpected challenge one example of a challenge that gain complexity be the scoreboard it require performance optimization controller navigation social feature interaction lot of UI work and tooltip many different engineer designer artist and analyst on different team contribute to the success of that one feature unlike some other flashy feature when the scoreboard be work well nobody notice it robmanfredsfixer how will you prioritize which hero will be add what kind of factor affect this Difficulty adapt they to the format popularity of a give hero consider you can not change hero have you consider prioritize popular one trick hero blizzduffin the current plan be to add new hero to stadium the mid season after they release for exist hero there be many factor that determine which hero enter the stadium while hero popularity be one gameplay be generally consider first kind of like how DVA be introduce into Overwatch at the same time Mei be its important to maintain healthy game balance when introduce new choice we hope to get everyone eventually but the live game be not always the good measurement of who should be next because stadium gameplay balance be very different from other live mode martinmayhem how do you feel about the fact that modern gaming community often focus heavily on minmaxe with the influence of content creator forum and other resource its now incredibly easy to access broken build rather than player experiment and figure thing out for themselves because stadium be currently competitive only there s a strong incentive to follow the path of least resistance which indirectly force player to go with the flow and look up optimize build rather than encourage they to create weird goofy and less optimal one falconkick I m glad you ask this question as I have some background on both side of this before I join Blizzard I create these sort of resource for the community and then after join I have be create the internal tool we use to stay ahead of this exact behavior as you ve mention player have incredible resource to improve in all aspect of our game and that s without we really share much datum at all in regular overwatch as well these sort of pressure to play optimally exist our strategy generally have be to keep the game fresh with regular change to combat this pressure and also fight against a feeling of staleness of play even the most beloved meta in the past grow repetitive over time and we owe it to our player to shake the game up on a regular basis I believe there be a sweet spot of adjust hero balance often enough that the game do not get stale but let thing stew long enough for player to master a give state of the game ultimately most of the optimal build comp or playstyle start off as goofy at one point or another and that part in a metas lifecycle be very important that be say its also very fun to play op stuff but just not for too long its a tricky line to walk its up to we to keep thing new fresh and change often enough that that cycle of discovery and mastery be a constant in our game be do the good that we can and learn with every patch I will say though our internal tool do indicate that there be if not a goofy herobuild certainly a lesspopular hero that be win quite handily that few player be play relatively Lucio swarlesbarkley can we expect any inspiration to be take from stadium itemspower and be use in future update to perk in the main mode or vice versa PS stadium be awesome thank for all that you do falconkick I may have pitch a stadium power as a major perk for a particular hero because I like it so much and a version of it may be come in the future but I m not sure I can say which one owlloverlivvy how do the balancing process for Stadium look compare to the rest of the game I imagine its a lot more complicated give that each character be basically 3 in 1 falconkick Hoo boy this be the big question be not it Stadium add many more layer of complexity to overwatch than the base game have economy bounty power item a different rank system ton and ton of depth of play in term of just raw dashboard count I think we have 34x as many way to look at balance for Stadium than for baseline competitive as a nonexhaustive list of what be consider we ve get power win and pick rate item win and pick rate Hero win and pick rate Item pick rate globally not consider hero economy datum where be player earn currency what be they spend it on Match outcome datum how long be match how often do comeback occur what be the relationship between economy and outcome and many many more the trickiest problem of they all be what to do with combination of power and item or Builds because there be an incredible amount of combination available in Stadium but only a few of they might be require to comprise what we as player would define as a Build this be a unique problem to Stadium that the base game simply do not have at good we can make an educate guess about what a build might be before try to roll up million of match worth of datum to analyze its performance but that approach be far too manual dependent on individual subjectivity and do not scale when we need to rapidly make change to Stadium to address balance concern we need a way to automate ask the right question what build exist for this hero before perform analysis be this build perform well we do so by pretreate the datum with cluster analysis on the hero and their poweritem combination which label the player and match with label like Build 1 or Build 2 such that they can be categorize define and aggregate later we then use various method power occurrence item occurrence ability keyword occurrence to describe the build so that we can say thing like Junker Queen Build 1 be a CarnageRampage build that tend to use the Thirsty for blood item and be able to say that Junker Queen Build 1 have whatever Win Rate or Usage Rate this give we deep insight into whether an individual power or item be overpower or if the combination of several power and item not individual be what could be target for nerf or buff visionairex this be an amazingly well think out and transparent answer thank you FalconKick anytime deafhaven which hero be most popular right now in Stadium falconkick Damage Soldier 76 be far out ahead of the rest however the rest of the cast be fairly close together Support Juno be mostpicke the rest be within 15 of her pick rate except for Lucio who be last by a fair margin he s very good though tank similarly to Soldier reinhardt be a decent way ahead of the rest of the tank but the rest of the tank be very closely group in pick rate cyberdavi7 how lose falconkick I winnt A55MA5TER69 do you have datum that track which item and power be the most popularhave the high winrate for every hero whether you do or not do you still plan to buff or nerf the power that feel like outlier falconkick short answer yes long answer this sort of balance tracking outlier on the high and low end be how we approach all of our design I write a little more information on that process in this post BlizzLarrypickle to add onto Bens answer datum play a big part in what we decide to buff nerf and we will be active in adjust power outlier however player perception also play a large part in what we decide to adjust and if something feel particularly difficult to counterplay or frustrating to play against we may adjust that soon even if the data suggest its not an outlier the two usually do support each other but not always IAmBLD what s the process for come up with item and build for a new hero like be there maybe scrap idea for Freja during development that become power later do you plan for future new hero to be fasttracke into Stadium blizzlarrypickle thank for the question we usually start with a set of archetype that hit on different fantasy or focus on a different part of the heros kit usually we want one core fantasy build that typically empower the core gameplay loop of that hero and then the other archetype typically introduce new gameplay pattern or more transformative effect after we have a set of archetype we usually want 23 core power to support each of those archetype and then the rest be fill out with more flexible power that be applicable to a number of archetype we do turn an early prototype for Frejas ultimate into a power I believe the current thinking be to prioritize get new hero into Stadium the midseason after they re release falconkick I m not a designer but Larry have to deal with I invade his dms with all sort of crackpot idea I m awesome at terrible idea so they just do the opposite of what I pitch beigemore at the end of a match will it ever be possible to show the good potg from the entire match rather than just the potg from the last round falconkick a play of play of the game the gameintriguing linkrtx want to know if there be any problem with animation while work on 3rd person view you say there be a lot of work hope to know if something funny be happen while do all this and thank you for your amazing dedication and passion for Overwatch you be lead the game in the good direction it ever could ve take blizzBruceW something interesting here be we have to expand our current animation system to be able to deal with uniquely tune VFX for the new 3rd person camera sometimes an effect can look great in 1p due to the camera perspective but when view that same vfx in 3p it start to not read correctly our vfx team do a great job finding and deal with a bunch of these felixw1 when be brigitte getting add blizzBruceW I ve offer to trade graphic feature for get Brigitte add doingmypart Shaclo be there any plan to add way to generate money from mitigate damage on tank it feels really incentivise to play aggressive and not as supportive with shielding upgrade as you often end up behind the enemy tank which lead to unfun one side game BlizzConorKouzy we do not have any plan to grant Stadium Cash from mitigate damage currently our Stadium cash generation from damage and healing match closely to how Ultimate Charge or Perk experience gain work Part of the reason for this be that some hero can mitigate infinite amount of damage look at you dva mitigate damage also prevent your opponent from generate Stadium cash just like it do to Ultimate Charge so there be some important currency impact that occur from damage mitigation we ve attempt to give every hero a tankierutility focus build path that player can pivot into when they re fall behind this be pair with our Survival item generally be low in price as intend to allow you to still be effective for your team even when you re not have your good game and this be not just isolate to tank I m sure you ve encounter a few tanky Reapers and soldier76s out there FalconKick to add to Conors post we do track where player be earn currency generally from various source and be keep track of the rate of currency gain across various hero and role BlizzKeville I feel you on this one it be one of my first bit of feedback after we add damage and healing base currency that we should consider add mitigation currency for this exact reason we even playteste with it for a while another reason behind the decision in addition to the one Conor mention be that it just sort of feel bad to know that any time you break Reins shield you just give he a ton of money it be almost like an infinite duration Zarya bubble where they keep the power in between round Icedmanta Hi first off I d like to say just how much my friend and I have be enjoy this mode it go beyond just a simple mode and feel like a whole new game how different have the development pipeline be from the standard base game dev team have there be any unique challenge or consideration that people might not expect it seem like there be so many more move part compare to the regular game and I m wonder what it look like on the other side of the glass BlizzKeville first off so happy to hear how much fun you and your friend be have this be amazing to hear one thing people might not expect be just how many different iteration Stadium go through on its journey to launch you can see a little bit of this by compare Stadium to Junkensteins lab whose random nature more closely resemble what we be consider ship Stadium with at the time when make something that you want to feel like a whole new experience there really be not any well way than to try something new play it yourself see if its fun and keep try until it be which can take a long time after many attempt at this be so excited about how Stadium turn out and the reception its getting from player like yourself CertainDerision33 since Stadium do not have swap how do the team think about design with add hero like Pharah or Ball who in regular play often demand swap in order to effectively interact with they Loving Stadium so far keep up the great work blizzconorkouzy in Stadium we be always strive for player to feel like they have the tool to pick from to adapt to their opponent we have try to create Hero Items that help soften some of the bad matchup we also try to create answer in the general item for example if you re struggle with beam hero we ve get a lot of way to get Armor to reduce a significant amount of that damage additionally we also try to create build and power that be strong in certain hero matchup ultimately be try to create an experience where you feel like you can play the hero you choose in any matchup even if you re at a slight disadvantage we know we ve not perfectly hit that mark just yet we will continue to try to add the answer every hero need as we continue to add more hero to Stadium we will also update previous hero to make sure they have the tool need to combat the newly add hero BlizzKeville expand on Conors answer one of the core goal of Stadiums design be that we empower you to replace counter swapping with counter build an example of the kind of upgrade we ve make for this be Genjis AntiBeam Coating which you can buy in those ZaryaMeiMoira game that ordinarily make you feel like you have to swap off to your point though we do have our design work cut out for we with Pharah and Ball which be part of why we decide not to include they in the launch roster can not speak to any specific yet but be certainly talk about way we can address these matchup too and make they fun technicalad2963 Loving Stadium have you guy explore customize presave load out similar to the prebuild the hero

Tank Hero Concept Lupa I havent done one of these in like a year so I thought itd be fun Please let me know what you think Lupa is supposed to be based on hero 45 who theyve been teasing since that devdoodle of a girl with a sword and recently with that poster of a gladiator named Lupa seen on the new Arena Victoriae map I thought the concept of a female gladiator with a wolf theme was really interesting and I wanted to take a stab at how Id make a kit based off of that To be honest tank is my least played role so I definitely struggled with creating her kit Reinhardt is currently the only melee tank but hes much more of a brawler I wanted Lupa to be more of a dive tank that really focused on coordinated attacks Heres a more detailed description of her kit Gameplay Role Tank HP 350

Stadium desperately needs solo queue as a mode that rewards teamwork so much Blizzard themselves says Stadium rewards teamwork even more than regular OW with build synergies etc While good teamwork is important in all areas of Overwatch 2 Stadium is best played when you can plan and test strategies that complement your teammates With an entirely separate ranked ladder that is more about winning games than showing who is best of the best individually Stadium is all about teamwork This obviously means that Solo players playing with and against stacks makes for even worse games than they do in standard but instead of trying to adress the solo player experience Blizzard managed to make it even worse in Stadium by removing narrow vs wide groups We want those of you that group up with friends to be able to play together regardless of the League each is ranked in so there wont be grouping restrictions nor will you be separated by Narrow or Wide groups Which means that you as a solo player can end up in a Stadium game with players ranging from Bronze to GM in skill due to no fault of your own but just because some stacks thought that would be fun for them and now you have to fill a spot in their game This is something that Narrow vs Wide groups made far less egregious Anyway 1 There should be a solo queue in regular OW as well but the situation is far worse in Stadium 2 The real reason for this change in Stadium is because Blizzard is terrified of high queue times ever since the end of OW 3 For that reason I doubt it will happen and since Blizzard loves coddling stacks but

Stadium is Great Hero Ban is Insufferable and Stupid Ive stopped playing Competitive Im only playing Stadium Stadium involves incredibly engaging decisions on how to build up your character to add value to your team With multiple build options that can be changed between rounds the Stadium experience is dynamic exciting and fun My teammates seem much more engaged in the game and far less inclined towards being toxic to each other On the other hand the introduction of hero bans to Competitive have made the game mode slower less dynamic and less fun My experience with bans has resulted in complete disinterest I dont indicate a preferred hero because I can be flexible and because I dont want my team to toxically troll me I dont care who is banned because Ive learned to adapt my playstyle or swap to play around counters so I have either just copied what the team wants to placate them or I have checked off ready immediately to signal to my team that Im comfortable with anything and that I just want to get on with the game My perception of the implications of the hero ban system is that 1 Players are denied the ability to play characters they want to play which is likely to lead to more toxicity leaving and throwing 2 Counterplay options are reduced enabling onetricks to remove a nuisance rather than learning how to play the game around counters 3 There is added waittime before the game starts that feels empty pointless and boring I also dont understand the direction which seems to run counter to everything else Overwatch is doing It stands in stark contrast to the Stadium mode that provides so many build options and to the recent introduction of perks Help me understand dear Overwatch Community of Reddit what is the theoretical or perceived

My ONE problem with stadium mode So stadium mode right Pretty fun enjoy playing it But Why does 76 have like multiple perks that give him auto aim Auto aim rocket auto aim after firing a rocket extra auto aim during auto aim ult Like idc if Im low elo or just bad but come on man Playing dps in this gamemode is like pulling teeth I can see why the queues for it are so quick compared to support and tank which is insane to me But just soldier Its so lame to play against and so boring to play as Like if I wanted to have autoaim all game Id just get cheats Edit Okay let me just clear up some things because some of yall have no sense 1 I think his ult is fine Ive always been okay with Soldiers ult Cause I know how long it lasted and you could hear when it gets activated What isnt okay is him getting it every 5 seconds on his rocket cooldown Autoaim rocketautoaim ult every 5 seconds isnt fun So like am I supposed to stay behind cover the entire game Because thats literally how it is Theres no indication of him getting it no voice line only the sound of his rocket which can get lost amongst the noise 2 Yes I know Juno is just as bad Ive replied to many comments agreeing with that as well It can be pretty annoying to deal with Same with Cassidy 3 Not every character is broken like some of you are suggesting I personally feel like a good amount of them are pretty underpowered I rarely see Dva in any of my games 4 Overwatch released a new game mode and made it ranked only Does that mean casual players arent allowed to play it Or have fun and enjoy it I havent touched ranked once since Ive owned the game at launch in 2016 All players deserve to have fun even the lower rank players And if Soldiers autoaim build a build that apparently isnt even strong in higher ranks apparently then what is the harm of nerfing it Why play my favorite hero like Ashe when a soldiercass can just autoaim and kill me within a fraction of a second Ill admit Im not the best at aiming plus I have good days and bad days Im sure plenty of other people do as well Why is someone using an autoaim build being rewarded in lower ranks more than someone who is actually trying to aim Please be forreal yall if you werent that good at a game and some guy was playing a character who autoaimed every 5 seconds I very much believe that you would get frustrated too Not responding to any replies anymore I

Moira Power Combo BrokenBugged Stadium Hello everyone I am here to report that a power combo I suspected should work together dont and I was wondering if its a bug or intentional If you take the empowering power that lets you damage boost allies there are a few bugs with it and a combo doesnt work when I think theoretically it should The combo that I think is broken and doesnt work is the Empowering you Chain Grasp The reason that I believe these are broken is because if I am able to target my allies then shouldnt the chain work on allies as well The way the power normally works is when you throw an orb the damage beam chains between enemies but if you have the empowering perk shouldnt it also chain the blue beam between allies The bugs I have noticed are the damage beam will apply to the person you first aimed it at even if you switch to another allied player without letting go of the damage input For example I damage boost mei and I flick it over to reaper the boost stays on mei even if I am not looking at her and the new target doesnt get it Another bug is that if you have the combo mentioned above if it doesnt chain to allies I can understand for balance reasons But if you take chain grasp and throw an orb then damage boost your tank who is surrounded by enemies The grasp doesnt chain to the enemies either Meaning if you take this combo you are actively harming your output and nerfing one of your perks Thank you for reading,Moira Power Combo BrokenBugged Stadium Hello everyone I am here to report that a power combo I suspected should work together do nt and I was wondering if its a bug or intentional If you take the empowering power that lets you damage boost allies there are a few bugs with it and a combo does nt work when I think theoretically it should The combo that I think is broken and does nt work is the Empowering you Chain Grasp The reason that I believe these are broken is because if I am able to target my allies then should nt the chain work on allies as well The way the power normally works is when you throw an orb the damage beam chains between enemies but if you have the empowering perk should nt it also chain the blue beam between allies The bugs I have noticed are the damage beam will apply to the person you first aimed it at even if you switch to another allied player without letting go of the damage input For example I damage boost mei and I flick it over to reaper the boost stays on mei even if I am not looking at her and the new target does nt get it Another bug is that if you have the combo mentioned above if it does nt chain to allies I can understand for balance reasons But if you take chain grasp and throw an orb then damage boost your tank who is surrounded by enemies The grasp does nt chain to the enemies either Meaning if you take this combo you are actively harming your output and nerfing one of your perks Thank you for reading,Moira Power Combo BrokenBugged Stadium hello everyone I be here to report that a power combo I suspect should work together do not and I be wonder if its a bug or intentional if you take the empower power that let you damage boost ally there be a few bug with it and a combo do not work when I think theoretically it should the combo that I think be break and do not work be the empower you Chain Grasp the reason that I believe these be break be because if I be able to target my ally then should not the chain work on ally as well the way the power normally work be when you throw an orb the damage beam chain between enemy but if you have the empower perk should not it also chain the blue beam between ally the bug I have notice be the damage beam will apply to the person you first aim it at even if you switch to another allied player without let go of the damage input for example I damage boost mei and I flick it over to reaper the boost stay on mei even if I be not look at she and the new target do not get it another bug be that if you have the combo mention above if it do not chain to ally I can understand for balance reason but if you take chain grasp and throw an orb then damage boost your tank who be surround by enemy the grasp do not chain to the enemy either mean if you take this combo you be actively harm your output and nerfe one of your perk thank you for read,Moira Power Combo BrokenBugged Stadium hello report power combo suspect work wonder bug intentional empower power let damage boost ally bug combo work think theoretically combo think break work empower Chain Grasp reason believe break able target ally chain work ally way power normally work throw orb damage beam chain enemy empower perk chain blue beam ally bug notice damage beam apply person aim switch allied player let damage input example damage boost mei flick reaper boost stay mei look new target bug combo mention chain ally understand balance reason chain grasp throw orb damage boost tank surround enemy grasp chain enemy mean combo actively harm output nerfe perk thank read

Overwatch 2 Lore and Story progression Hi I suppose its my first post here Also English isnt my native language so there may be some errors The new season begins with a lot of game updates new activities hero BP etc new mythic skin also looks amazing But recently Ive seen a new article The Art and Style of Dokiwatch and the one phrase caught my attention Narratively Dokiwatch is also a chance to temporarily escape the more serious angles of the games ongoing story What ongoing story are you talking about The big last story and lore update was with the release of as you called it PvE Campaign lol We havent had any lore or story updates after those events A few short stories released on the website recently were released much earlier in the book that came out a few months near the release of pve missions and show the same events from different angles of the world or points of view without going any further I know that the biggest story campaign in history ever made was a failure I dont even know why But you stopped revealing the story at all Even Overwatch 1 was better it frequently gives us some new parts of lore New short comics stories CINEMATICS books Even releasing a new hero gives us new parts which can be found in the phrases lorebased skins with story descriptions Currently new heroes dont even have many skins and ones that are coming with new seasons are just fanfics as themes of seasons at all The only description we get is just the note that those skins can be bought in the store We havent gotten any new maps for a long ago and even those we get dont have any new lore parts Do you remember as we analyzed the history of the place from the things laid out on the map There is nothing like this in the new maps I was looking at them with every new release but the last of them are just maps without even a glimpse of lore I dont even say anything about the Archives event that gives us at least 1 new mission a year and a bunch of new lore skins and details Those free updates werent a failure but 3 paid missions are in the new client that was remade for easier PvE development according to your interview OK You have so many ways to continue the story without PvE you dont use even the ways you already had in OW1 The fun point even Concord was better in revealing the story Many of you know that game only as a failure at it really was but it had one concept that the Overwatch team could learn In the game it was called Galactic Guide by playing games players can unlock places stories on the global database Every week there was a new short cutscene that revealed a new weeks theme Daily and weekly quests also had themed descriptions in such a way it slowly but regularly represents characters world and ongoing events But the game itself was really bad so it just didnt reach any serious story points You can use this method you can use BP to reveal the story as you already tried on Questwatch I remember in 2023 roadmap was some Lore codex that wasnt released either Some old multiplayer games as Bioshock 2 or Assassins Creed Revelations multiplayer mode had lore notes and cinematics that unlocked according to the reached player levels But you do nothing at all and say that you are tired of a serious ongoing story You know Im not a fan of PvP The reason I play this game is the fun gameplay how characters are playing how cool it was to dream about fullexperienced pve modes I even closed last BP only by playing those 3 missions we get and 17 years since Blizzard opened the door to a new adventure to a new world Im really ashamed that OW2 which was announced as a lore and story explosion leads us to this state As a player not interested in PvP it reminds me of last years of Heroes of the Storm where only skins and heroes were the only updates and in the end the games support was closed I still have hope that we will get a happy turn of events thats why I decided to write a post on the forum in hopes that maybe some devs will read it and will know that there are players who still want to continue their journey into this interesting world Thank you,Overwatch 2 Lore and Story progression Hi I

do hero picks matter in metal ranks hello everyone im fairly new to overwatch coming up on a year of playing yay i do watch educational content surrounding the heroes i play vod reviews guides tips and things like that and generally i feel more comfortable on support started OW by playing kiri then swapped over to learning moira brig LW ana mercy and more recently juno ive seen all the discourse over the past few months about basically just how bad mercy and LW are and so my question is in metal ranks if that even matters i feel like ive learned a lot about playing mercy and LW i know to dmg boost dps and prioritize res on tanks and staying alive on LW its giving and accessing high ground easily consistent heals and decent poke dmg on tanks and saving teammates with grip without sacrificing map control etc recently ive had a few games where i just want to play either of those 2 heroes and before the game even starts teammates will either ban my pick or assume we will lose because those heroes dont provide value and that thought was really shocking to me because any video i see by high elo players talking about the meta or talking about lower elo players is that the heroes you choose dont really matter and that in metal ranks pretty much its anything goes as long as ur able to stay alive and do ur job by healingpressuremaking space its fine at least thats what i thought but people seem to think it matters solely on the hero youre playing i actually felt so bad seeing all the hate mercy was getting and although shes my main it made me not play her anymore for fear i would get called out in chat and have people flaming me for no reason if i want to be mercy but were running winston torb tracer im not gonna stay mercy if i keep dying and am not able to dmg boost then ill swap its frustrating having people assume im shit at the game for the hero i choose of course not everything will work all the time no matter the elo but am i wrong for being in goldlow plat wanting to play off meta heroes is it really that bad to play them in this rank i just dont get the play a real support comments yeah there are bad mercys that healbot tank yeah theres bad LWs that pull you out of ult or whatever but were also in the same rank mistakes happen on every role and thats how we learn and get better and i do want to get better but cant i be good at LW cant i be a good mercy i mean as good as you can get in gold but still it feels weird maybe a bit unrelated but just saw a youtube video of a guy target banning his teams ashe pick only because they were an ashe main and the streamer is just there laughing and giggling at him being upset that they banned ashe that really rubbed me the wrong way anyways ive learned now just to not pick a preferred hero cause

Experience should be consistent and perks ruined that Generally speaking some characters have better matchup against some characters and some characters dont A good genji player is always going to have the upper hand against a good illari player In a dive scenario I would say its at least a 6040 for the genji player This dynamic would stay constant for an entire match before introduction of the perk system With the perk system this dynamic would change in the late stage of a game Illairs sun burn allows you to apply 70 burning dmg on the enemy who got hit by your outburst turning it into an ability that deals 95 dmg over a few seconds This completely changes the dynamic between her and genji Every time I play Illari I can feel the difference this perk is making The 4060 match up for me would almost always turn into a 7030 after getting this perk I just shred enemy genji with outburst every time he wants to dive me It is infuriating I do not do anything to earn this perk Enemy genji do not do anything to deserve getting nerfed mid match In fact I can even get the perk earlier by spamming dmg on the enemy tank instead of contesting divers on an off angle I dont like how matchups can just change mid match without either side improvingimpairing their gameplay It feels cheap It feels unrewarding And it makes the game feel inconsistent Id much rather be disadvantaged against genji for the whole game then just suddenly be able to shred him mid match Now Im not saying matchups shouldnt be changed If Blizzard wants to rework Illari into more of a kiribrig type character instead of a bapzen character I would be fine with it but making this change in the late stage of mid match is unacceptable This is how I feel about most of the perks but especially Illaris since I main her Before perks I could play ow for 1020 matches on weekends Now 5 matches can make me feel exhausted and uncomfortable I just wish we can get the old vanilla experience back,Experience should

change the dynamic between she and genji every time I play Illari I can feel the difference this perk be make the 4060 match up for I would almost always turn into a 7030 after get this perk I just shre enemy genji with outburst every time he want to dive I it be infuriate I do not do anything to earn this perk Enemy genji do not do anything to deserve getting nerfe mid match in fact I can even get the perk early by spamme dmg on the enemy tank instead of contest diver on an off angle I do not like how matchup can just change mid match without either side improvingimpaire their gameplay it feel cheap it feel unrewarding and it make the game feel inconsistent I d much rather be disadvantage against genji for the whole game then just suddenly be able to shred he mid match now I m not say matchup should not be change if Blizzard want to rework Illari into more of a kiribrig type character instead of a bapzen character I would be fine with it but make this change in the late stage of mid match be unacceptable this be how I feel about most of the perk but especially Illaris since I main she before perk I could play ow for 1020 match on weekend now 5 match can make I feel exhausted and uncomfortable I just wish we can get the old vanilla experience back,experience consistent perk ruin generally speak character matchup character character good genji player upper hand good illari player dive scenario 6040 genji player dynamic stay constant entire match introduction perk system perk system dynamic change late stage game Illairs sun burn allow apply 70 burn dmg enemy hit outburst turn ability deal 95 dmg second completely change dynamic genji time play Illari feel difference perk 4060 match turn 7030 perk shre enemy genji outburst time want dive infuriate earn perk Enemy genji deserve getting nerfe mid match fact perk early spamme dmg enemy tank instead contest diver angle like matchup change mid match improvingimpaire gameplay feel cheap feel unrewarding game feel inconsistent d disadvantage genji game suddenly able shred mid match m matchup change Blizzard want rework Illari kiribrig type character instead bapzen character fine change late stage mid match

Nerf Stadium Perks NOT Stadium Cash It would so much more fun to have more slightly weaker powers then to be scrounging for cash and having way fewer slightly stronger powers The same problem they had when they power crept everything in overwatch 1 and started nerfing everything until it was terrible It will happen again in OW2 stadium we just keep making things more unreachable and less fun to use,Nerf Stadium Perks NOT Stadium Cash It would so much more fun to have more slightly weaker powers then to be scrounging for cash and having way fewer slightly stronger powers The same problem they had when they power crept everything in overwatch 1 and started nerfing everything until it was terrible It will happen again in OW2 stadium we just keep making things more unreachable and less fun to use,Nerf Stadium Perks not Stadium cash it would so much more fun to have more slightly weak power then to be scrounge for cash and have way few slightly strong power the same problem they have when they power creep everything in overwatch 1 and start nerfe everything until it be terrible it will happen again in OW2 stadium we just keep make thing more unreachable and less fun to use,Nerf Stadium Perks Stadium cash fun slightly weak power scrounge cash way slightly strong power problem power creep overwatch 1 start nerfe terrible happen OW2 stadium thing unreachable fun use

DroneCentric Hero Concept So I have always wanted drones in the game I cant tell you why but its always been a fun idea to me so now finally Ive made it For this post I want feedback on the ideas themselves and if it would be too much too little or worst of all too boring So first health and passives Also he is an omnic so yippie more Omnic heroes UAVthe hero as of now will have 250 base health and his passives will consist of the DPS passive and a passive called Lift His Lift passive allows him to fly upward with a drone and this lets him gain high ground Think Sigmas levitate perk but better Now for his primary and secondary fires UAVs primary is called Nanite Drones Hell shoot small drones out of his finger that will explode when making contact with enemies but wont do AOE damage Theyll be about as fast as a Hanzo Storm Arrow maybe a little slower Hell have about 15 ammo for his primary fire one being consumed per shot UAVs secondary is called Nanite Cluster UAV will shoot out about 5 small drones that when one explodes they all explode and these do do small AOE damage Each burst of Nanites will cost 5 ammo Next up is his abilities UAVs ability one is called Tracking Drone Hell throw a drone onto an enemy that will then do 1 of 2 things A It will make the targets footstep glow B In cases like Moira a trail will be left behind to give the general direction she went while in fade This Tracking Drone will last for about 3 seconds and the enemy affected will have the revealed status the whole time UAVs ability two is called Locator Drone Hell throw this drone out and itll shoot straight up into the sky box If UAV presses the ability again then his POV will switch to the drone and he can use it like a camera The drone cannot move but its camera can and enemies are pingable through it these enemies will be revealed for a moment UAV cannot move while in the POV of this drone think Junkrat Riptire If its destroyed itll take a moment before UAV can move and see from his body again Unlike Riptire if UAV dies he will instantly lose POV of his drone but the drone will stay until destroyed or replaced Finally his ultimate UAVs ultimate is called Nanite Swarm Hell open up a Holomap of the around around him and can select an area on it He can either place two dots or a hold and swipe with his camera stick Once its placed a much of floating Nanites Drones will spawn if they are trigger they will explode in a wave in the direction that the player swiped or placed the dots To visualize better think of Brimstone from Valorant and how places smokes then the rest should be easier to visualize Currently I have no perks for UAV as hes in his first draft of conception so please give any feedback that you think would help Still keep feedback

Overwatch bugs and QoL changes Have the devs acknowledged anywhere the disappearance of both the leaderboard and your open queue rank in your profile Theres been 4 patches already this season with no fixmention and the pinned post about known bugs on the blizzard forums have no mention of it And why have there been a bunch of small quality of life changes theyre ignorednever addressed Examples of easy wins they could get are Putting Kirikos TP on cooldawn when spawning so she cant immediately TP back to the fight just like ball Bringing back the environmental kill icon to bring some flavour back to the game obviously their enviro kill info has been broken since ow2 came out since they dont give credit when deserved and reverse so why not add it back anyways Give the ability to unbind the scoreboard interact key So to save 00001 second you can now mute or report people right from the scoreboard at the cost of not being able to melee while looking at the scoreboard if theyre going to make their game worse can they at least let you opt out of it They also randomly changed the way you go through menus yet again do you have to hold start and then press X to cancel queue now And why change the way you exit end screens from B to A except for 1 screen where you have to press B so you cant just spam it Who asked for this Is it just a dev trying to justify being employed This has always been a flaw in the game as far as I know but why do you keep your hero in mystery heroes if you kill yourself after taking damage It lets strong characters like pharah ashe and sigma keep their characters How hard would it be to make it so if someone has taken 50 of their health as damage in the last however many seconds their death counts as being done by an opponent In a regular game recenetly I got hit by a soldier helix then 5 seconds later jumped off the map to reset and it gave him credit lol why can that jankiness not be used for good in mystery heroes Why not include the reason someone got banned in your thanks for reporting message Rivals lets you know if someone you reported got banned who they were and why they got banned I honestly believe 0 people Ive reported have gotten banned for gameplay sabotage repeatedly sprinting off map lifeweaver gripping people to try and get off map etc or for ximmingsmurfing the thanks for reporting only seems to come in for bad language lol but it would be nice to confirm I shouldnt be wasting time reporting people These are just a few small things they can change about the game to remove pain points but whether theyre things that have existed for 9 years or 9 days they havent been acknowledged either way which is pretty sad to see I know they say stadium hasnt taken any dev time away from the main game but when it took them a year to fix baps game breaking immortaility bug on console no real balance updates for months at times um hello why is ball still busted rn and no maps fro the last 4 seasons it makes a

How to win with every launch hero in Stadium Finally managed to complete the Team Player challenge for the Stadium mode so thought Id post some tips on what builds worked best for me to help anyone struggling with this Ana Put everything into Weapon Power and take the Tactical Rifle power for superpowered damage and healing Powerswise go for Comfy Cloud AoE sleep dart Time Out nade does knockback and Our Turn Nanoboost everyone in LOS The first two help against flankers the latter is basically a teamfight winner if you use it right Put some points into Survival perks early on as you are possibly the most vulnerable support in the match most of the time Ashe Focus on Weapon Power and Ability Power you will usually be sniping from the back so you dont need a ton of Survival stuff Powerswise go for Molten Munitions and Out With A Bang first building around Ashes dynamite is often super effective against the deathball style fights this mode promotes BOB Jr is also a great pick if you find you are usually losing the first fight each round you can swing it in your favour with the 50 ult charge requirement and gain the advantage Cassidy Weapon Power Thats it By midgame you want to be at 5060 Weapon Power and you will be effectively twotapping everything that isnt a tank The Just Roll With It and Barrel Roll powers are the most useful in my opinion dont bother with any Deadeye powers as few maps give you a good chance to use it properly You can also stack ammo increase perks and combo with Full House for additional damage DVA The recent nerfs make the baby DVA build less viable but my preference is to go with a missileheavy build anyway you want to take the Overstocked Legendary Loadout and Facetanking powers then just fly at enemy squishies Important in most tank matchups you are not going to win so just fly into the backline and kill less mobile enemies and let your team deal with the Reinhardt or Junker Queen that is giving you grief A nasty little perk for DVA is the ElSaka Suppressor epic weapon ability middle of 3rd row which inflicts 30 less healing on critical hits With DVAs primary fire being so spread your target is basically lightly antinaded permanently while you kill them Genji If youre comfortable with Genji then ignore this but if youre like me and cant land his combos to save your life do the following take Iaido Strike DB slash after Deflect as your first power and Forged Under Fire heal from Deflect as your second You will basically be flanking dashing into an unprotected squishy land a couple of shurikens and then use the DB slash after Deflect to finish them off On top of this pump points into Ability Power to buff your initial Swift Strike damage If you are confident in landing shurikens then buff Weapon Power but I found the buffed abilities to be easier to get that burst damage with Junker Queen I built my JQ around Chop Chop 2 axe charges Lets Go Win elims reset Commanding Shout and Reckoners Roar Shout wounds enemies within range Put points into Ability Damage leading up to these The order of operations with this build is basically to run at a squishy using CSs speedboost use backtoback axe strikes to burst them down then reset your shout on that elim and go again The enemy team is now taking constant DoT from your shout which gets buffed by Ability Power focused burst damage from your axe also buffed by Ability Power and every elim continues the combo Just dont go for the enemy tank first with this unless theyre already low Juno Obviously the torpedo build has been nerfed but is still super strong Pulsar Plus is a great first round power followed by Cosmic Coolant and then Medicinal Missiles All of your points should go into Ability Power first Weapon Power second If the enemy team starts shooting you out of the air with hitscan invest in Armoured Vest Reinforced Titanium and Divine Intervention to up your survivability It is probably obvious but make sure to use your Hyper Ring at the start of every round Juno is one of the two heroes that can get your team to the central objective first which is often the decider of the first fight Kiriko Kirikos kunai and ofuda both count as weapons so put everything into Weapon Power perks to boost healing and damage simultaneously TwoZu is my goto first power with Supported Shooting and Leaf on the Wind as secondary ones that really help sustain your frontline as they push forward Teamwork Toolkit rare Weapon perk right at the bottom of the blues and Amaris Antidote epic Weapon perk 2nd row third perk worked really well for this build basically help you to heal critical allies to full in one go while letting them speed themselves out of danger Lucio Healbot Lucio is an easy win if your team is halfway competent You can combo Reverb two boop charges and Crowd Pleaser healing burst after boop early on to save critical allies Couple with Megaphone and Radio Edit if the match goes on that long for even greater sustain There is also a broken Lucio build if you are confident in your DPS Lucio mechanics take Reverb and Lets Bounce for a 170DMG higher if Ability Power is buffed burst of damage as you effectively become Doomfist and oneshot squishies by slamming them into walls For perks be looking for ability cooldown perks as much as possible to give you Amp It Up as much as possible Mei The devil herself Meis build is mostly based around spamming her CryoFreeze Take Coulder Cryclone and Frost Nova to be as annoying as possible whenever you press Shift Buffing Weapon Power basically turns Mei into Cassidy after a certain point where a single icicle crit will almost oneshot people and no falloff Make sure youre using walls almost on cooldown almost all of the maps have wallsized chokepoints that make it fantastic for winning first fight and snowballing pun intended the round off of that Mercy Distortion is a favourite early power of mine followed by Threads of Fate You just pick whoever is your best DPS or the tank if neither is good and pocketheal them Triage Unit is good for saving allies that push a bit too far up Mercys Staff counts as a weapon so boost Weapon damage as much as possible Also look to nab the Caduceus Ex perk the red epic Weapon perk ASAP as you can stand further back from the frontline while still being connected Also worthy of note is the Long Distance Wings perk rare Ability bottom row which lets you get in and out more easily Boosting whoever has significant Weapon Power perks on your team is hugely effective as they will quickly hit oneshot territory Reinhardt and Cassidy are your best targets in my experience but follow the money literally whoever has the most earnings for a win Moira Moira like DVA has a nasty hidden combo the Cybervenom 30 less healing epic Ability perk makes it so her orbs inflict constant healing debuffs to basically the entire enemy team Stack this with CrossOrbal and every fight becomes easy On your way to getting this combo go for Empowering You and CrossOrbal as your early powers and just pocket your frontline with orb primary fire damage boost until something dies then snowball the fight Everyone goes Multiball for some reason I dont think it has quite the effectiveness it looks like it should have Moiras left and right click are both weapons so make sure to dump extra points into Weapon Power whenever possible Orisa Spam the everliving hell out of Fortify and Javelin spin Orisa is a huge counter to many tanks except Zarya so you basically want to be surviving as long as possible on the frontline until the enemy tank breaks first To this end Factory Reset Hooves of Steel and Restortify work really well together just keep an eye on the cooldowns and keep rotating between Fortify and Javelin spin depending on the amount of incoming damage Elite Rotator Cuff rare Ability Efis Theorem epic Ability and as many cooldown reductions as you can get are good here Crusader Hyraulics rare Survival 10 dmg reduction while you have armour is also great because Orisa is like 90 armour health Reaper Do not pick the Death Blossom on teleport power I know you want to Every Reaper does and they instantly die every time now Revolving Ruin Spirited to Slay and Wraith Renewal are far better picks in my opinion You need to be able to get in close and for that you need to be tanky Pick Survival perks that give you overhealth armour andor damage reduction early on Obviously dump a ton into Weapon Power too not only do you deal more damage but you also gain more lifesteal per shot enhancing your tankiness Reinhardt Rein is scariest when you buff Ability and Weapon Damage stacked with Smashing and any of the Firestrike powers Look for movementattack speed increase perks like Aftermarket Firing Pin rare Weapon perk and anything that makes FS scarier like Chimeras Maw rare Ability 50 FS radius increase You basically want to be almost oneshotting enemies in chokes with FS and then killing them in two swings once they get into melee range If you are finding you are getting burst down a lot before you can get any damage in look at taking the Wilhelmwagen power and Crusader Hydraulics early and stack lifesteal perks on top of that Soldier 76 Obviously everyone knows the visor build is strong Not sure if it still is after the nerf but Super Visor Peripheral Pulse and Double Helix are great burst damage Just try to actually hit something with the initial Helix rather than just firing it blindly to proc miniVisor Ability power increases will boost both Helix and Biotic Field so are a good early choice Make sure to keep on top of Weapon Power too though or your miniVisors will become less effective Try to adapt your weapon perks to what youre facing Salvaged Slugs is good for ReinhardtZarya comps Codebreaker is great against Orisa etc Zarya I found Containment Shield to be handy for saving allies that go too deep Barrier Benefits and PreWorkout do wonders for your sustain and Volskaya Vortex is good if youre constantly fighting at long ranges You want to be reducing your bubble cooldowns as much as possible so look for those perks Weapon power perks are more effective only if youre constantly at high energy so maybe focus on survivability early on Reinforced Titanium 15 less ability damage while you have shields is fantastic for Zarya since you effectively always have 15 damage reduction due to her massive amount of shields Hopefully these tips can help someone here out in getting through their problem heroes for the challenge,How to win with every launch hero in Stadium Finally managed to complete the Team Player challenge for the Stadium mode so thought I d post some tips on what builds worked best for me to help anyone struggling with this Ana Put everything into Weapon Power and take the Tactical Rifle power for superpowered damage and healing Powerswise go for Comfy Cloud AoE sleep dart Time Out nade does knockback and Our Turn Nanoboost everyone in LOS The first two help against flankers the latter is basically a teamfight winner if you use it right Put some points into Survival perks early on as you are possibly the most vulnerable support in the match most of the time Ashe Focus on Weapon Power and Ability Power you will usually be sniping from the back so you do nt need a ton of Survival stuff Powerswise go for Molten Munitions and Out With A Bang first building around Ashes dynamite is often super effective against the deathball style fights this mode promotes BOB Jr is also a great pick if you find you are usually losing the first fight each round you can swing it in your favour with the 50 ult charge requirement and gain the advantage Cassidy Weapon Power That s it By midgame you want to be at 5060 Weapon Power and you will be effectively twotapping everything that is nt a tank The Just Roll With It and Barrel Roll powers are the most useful in my opinion do nt bother with any Deadeye powers as few maps give you a good chance to use it properly You can also stack ammo increase perks and combo with Full House for additional damage DVA The recent nerfs make the baby DVA build less viable but my preference is to go with a missileheavy build anyway you want to take the Overstocked Legendary Loadout and Facetanking powers then just fly at enemy squishies Important in most tank matchups you are not going to win so just fly into the backline and kill less mobile enemies and let your team deal with the Reinhardt or Junker Queen that is giving you grief A nasty little perk for DVA is the ElSaka Suppressor epic weapon ability middle of 3rd row which inflicts 30 less healing on critical hits With DVAs primary fire being so spread your target is basically lightly antinaded permanently while you kill them Genji If you re comfortable with Genji then ignore this but if you re like me and ca nt land his combos to save your life do the following take Iaido Strike DB slash after Deflect as your first power and Forged Under Fire heal from Deflect as your second You will basically be flanking dashing into an unprotected squishy land a couple of shurikens and then use the DB slash after Deflect to finish them off On top of this pump points into Ability Power to buff your initial Swift Strike damage If you are confident in landing shurikens then buff Weapon Power but I found the buffed abilities to be easier to get that burst damage with Junker Queen I built my JQ around Chop Chop 2 axe charges Lets Go Win elims reset Commanding Shout and Reckoners Roar Shout wounds enemies within range Put points into Ability Damage leading up to these The order of operations with this build is basically to run at a squishy using CSs speedboost use backtoback axe strikes to burst them down then reset your shout on that elim and go again The enemy team is now taking constant DoT from your shout which gets buffed by Ability Power focused burst damage from your axe also buffed by Ability Power and every elim continues the combo Just do nt go for the enemy tank first with this unless they re already low Juno Obviously the torpedo build has been nerfed but is still super strong Pulsar Plus is a great first round power followed by Cosmic Coolant and then Medicinal Missiles All of your points should go into Ability Power first Weapon Power second If the enemy team starts shooting you out of the air with hitscan invest in Armoured Vest Reinforced Titanium and Divine Intervention to up your survivability It is probably obvious but make sure to use your Hyper Ring at the start of every round Juno is one of the two heroes that can get your team to the central objective first which is often the decider of the first fight Kiriko Kirikos kunai and ofuda both count as weapons so put everything into Weapon Power perks to boost healing and damage simultaneously TwoZu is my goto first power with Supported Shooting and Leaf on the Wind as secondary ones that really help sustain your frontline as they push forward Teamwork Toolkit rare Weapon perk right at the bottom of the blues and Amaris Antidote epic Weapon perk 2nd row third perk worked really well for this build basically help you to heal critical allies to full in one go while letting them speed themselves out of danger Lucio Healbot Lucio is an easy win if your team is halfway competent You can combo Reverb two boop charges and Crowd Pleaser healing burst after boop early on to save critical allies Couple with Megaphone and Radio Edit if the match goes on that long for even greater sustain There is also a broken Lucio build if you are confident in your DPS Lucio mechanics take Reverb and Lets Bounce for a 170DMG higher if Ability Power is buffed burst of damage as you effectively become Doomfist and oneshot squishies by slamming them into walls For perks be looking for ability cooldown perks as much as possible to give you Amp It Up as much as possible Mei The devil herself Meis build is mostly based around spamming her CryoFreeze Take Coulder Cryclone and Frost Nova to be as annoying as possible whenever you press Shift Buffing Weapon Power basically turns Mei into Cassidy after a certain point where a single icicle crit will almost oneshot people and no falloff Make sure you re using walls almost on cooldown almost all of the maps have wallsized chokepoints that make it fantastic for winning first fight and snowballing pun intended the round off of that Mercy Distortion is a favourite early power of mine followed by Threads of Fate You just pick whoever is your best DPS or the tank if neither is good and pocketheal them Triage Unit is good for saving allies that push a bit too far up Mercys Staff counts as a weapon so boost Weapon damage as much as possible Also look to nab the Caduceus Ex perk the red epic Weapon perk ASAP as you can stand further back from the frontline while still being connected Also worthy of note is the Long Distance Wings perk rare Ability bottom row which lets you get in and out more easily Boosting whoever has significant Weapon Power perks on your team is hugely effective as they will quickly hit oneshot territory Reinhardt and Cassidy are your best targets in my experience but follow the money literally whoever has the most earnings for a win Moira Moira like DVA has a nasty hidden combo the Cybervenom 30 less healing epic Ability perk makes it so her orbs inflict constant healing debuffs to basically the entire enemy team Stack this with CrossOrbal and every fight becomes easy On your way to getting this combo go for Empowering You and CrossOrbal as your early powers and just pocket your frontline with orb primary fire damage boost until something dies then snowball the fight Everyone goes Multiball for some reason I do nt think it has quite the effectiveness it looks like it should have Moiras left and right click are both weapons so make sure to dump extra points into Weapon Power whenever possible Orisa Spam the everliving hell out of Fortify and Javelin spin Orisa is a huge counter to many tanks except Zarya so you basically want to be surviving as long as possible on the frontline until the enemy tank breaks first To this end Factory Reset Hooves of Steel and Restortify work really well together just keep an eye on the cooldowns and keep rotating between Fortify and Javelin spin depending on the amount of incoming damage Elite Rotator Cuff rare Ability Efis Theorem epic Ability and as many cooldown reductions as you can get are good here Crusader Hyraulics rare Survival 10 dmg reduction while you have armour is also great because Orisa is like 90 armour health Reaper Do not pick the Death Blossom on teleport power I know you want to Every Reaper does and they instantly die every time now Revolving Ruin Spirited to Slay and Wraith Renewal are far better picks in my opinion You need to be able to get in close and for that you need to be tanky Pick Survival perks that give you overhealth armour andor damage reduction early on Obviously dump a ton into Weapon Power too not only do you deal more damage but you also gain more lifesteal per shot enhancing your tankiness Reinhardt Rein is scariest when you buff Ability and Weapon Damage stacked with Smashing and any of the Firestrike powers Look for movementattack speed increase perks like Aftermarket Firing Pin rare Weapon perk and anything that makes FS scarier like Chimeras Maw rare Ability 50 FS radius increase You basically want to be almost oneshotting enemies in chokes with FS and then killing them in two swings once they get into melee range If you are finding you are getting burst down a lot before you can get any damage in look at taking the Wilhelmwagen power and Crusader Hydraulics early and stack lifesteal perks on top of that Soldier 76 Obviously everyone knows the visor build is strong Not sure if it still is after the nerf but Super Visor Peripheral Pulse and Double Helix are great burst damage Just try to actually hit something with the initial Helix rather than just firing it blindly to proc miniVisor Ability power increases will boost both Helix and Biotic Field so are a good early choice Make sure to keep on top of Weapon Power too though or your miniVisors will become less effective Try to adapt your weapon perks to what you re facing Salvaged Slugs is good for ReinhardtZarya comps Codebreaker is great against Orisa etc Zarya I found Containment Shield to be handy for saving allies that go too deep Barrier Benefits and PreWorkout do wonders for your sustain and Volskaya Vortex is good if you re constantly fighting at long ranges You want to be reducing your bubble cooldowns as much as possible so look for those perks Weapon power perks are more effective only if you re constantly at high energy so maybe focus on survivability early on Reinforced Titanium 15 less ability damage while you have shields is fantastic for Zarya since you effectively always have 15 damage reduction due to her massive amount of shields Hopefully these tips can help someone here out in getting through their problem heroes for the challenge,how to win with every launch hero in Stadium finally manage to

Stadium is great Maybe some perks need tuning Zarya is the typical tank that counters Dva but theyve given Dva a perk that gives her 23 damage resistance to beams while matrix is active You go from being smoked to being able to face tank a lot of damage in round 2 Does Zarya have an answer to that somehow The power buildup becomes a bit ludicrous at times especially if the rounds reach the 7th game At this point Im going around with a Reinhardt with 400 health600 armour3200 shield Mei theres always one is a perpetual presence on the point with that snowball of hers and those last games become huge brawls between incredibly powerful characters Im liking the system a lot and Im having fun The gameplay tweaks help reduce downtime for most players and I feel the cash system does capture performance better The bounty system lets you identify the high value targets and it feels good both when you hunt the victim in question and also when you see your bounty growing and the enemy team more and more desperate to get your hide Maybe its also a good way to detect smurfs I find it a huge positive,Stadium is great Maybe some perks need tuning Zarya is the typical tank that counters Dva but they ve given Dva a perk that gives her 23 damage resistance to beams while matrix is active You go from being smoked to being able to face tank a lot of damage in round 2 Does Zarya have an answer to that somehow The power buildup becomes a bit ludicrous at times especially if the rounds reach the 7th game At this point I m going around with a Reinhardt with 400 health600 armour3200 shield Mei there s always one is a perpetual presence on the point with that snowball of hers and those last games become huge brawls between incredibly powerful characters I m liking the system a lot and I m having fun The gameplay tweaks help reduce downtime for most players and I feel the cash system does capture performance better The bounty system lets you identify the high value targets and it feels good both when you hunt the victim in question and also when you see your bounty growing and the enemy team more and more desperate to get your hide Maybe its also a good way to detect smurfs I find it a huge positive,Stadium be great maybe some perk need tune Zarya be the typical tank that counter Dva but they ve give Dva a perk that give she 23 damage resistance to beam while matrix be active you go from be smoke to be able to face tank a lot of damage in round 2 do Zarya have an answer to that somehow the power buildup become a bit ludicrous at time especially if the round reach the 7th game at this point I m go around with a Reinhardt with 400 health600 armour3200 shield Mei there s always one be a perpetual presence on the point with that snowball of hers and those last game become huge brawl between incredibly powerful character I m like the system a lot and I m have fun the gameplay tweak help reduce downtime for most player and I feel the cash system do capture performance well the bounty system let you identify the high value target and it feel good both when you hunt the victim in question and also when you see your bounty grow and the enemy team more and more desperate to get your hide maybe its also a good way to detect smurfs I find it a huge positive,Stadium great maybe perk need tune Zarya typical tank counter Dva ve Dva perk 23 damage resistance beam matrix active smoke able face tank lot damage round 2 Zarya answer power buildup bit ludicrous time especially round reach 7th game point m Reinhardt 400 health600 armour3200 shield Mei s perpetual presence point snowball game huge brawl incredibly powerful character m like system lot m fun gameplay tweak help reduce downtime player feel cash system capture performance bounty system let identify high value target feel good hunt victim question bounty grow enemy team desperate hide maybe good way detect smurfs find huge positive
Rumors so far With roster lock in sight how many rumors do we have here and how likely are they These are for people who might not be as terminally online as me Reminder that these are just rumors and not set in stone and can easily change Viol2tSince Viol2t is participating in faceit on vision esports it means that he will not be able to join an owcs team for stage 2 The rumor is that he left for personal reasonsto dodge military service and once he was lft Vision outbid everyone and offered a larger amount of salary than even Zeta division previously TMTwisted Minds hasnt officially released Irony but he is almost certainly off the roster Cointree has mentioned on CXs stream that this is mainly due to the large language barrier above all else The rumor is that they are going to get Simple as their flex support but I dont know how credible this is As for did they try to bid for Viol2t from what Ive heard they already had someone else by the time Viol2t was lft There is also a rumor that Sirmajed is going to TM but I dont think this one is super likely TUHeesung is already semi confirmed on TU both on uncoachable with Unter saying that Chris got a korean main tank and Chris himself on CXs stream chat This means that Faith is likely the one getting released and Twilight likely staying As for who they are getting on main support I have no clue NTMRWith Zeruhh not appearing on faceit with the exNTMR players and instead Wmaimone appearing there it is likely that he was picked up by presumably Liquid Knife is still in NA so I dont know what is going on Rumor says that Envy also mightve picked up the rest of the NTMR players but still very muddy S9mmThe rumor says that he will be making a return to Pro Overwatch by joining Supernova for NA owcs as Chime has shifted most of his focus to Marvel Rivals Very likely to happen Frost TailsFrost Tails are a team that clenched top 8 for owcs through relegation but their tank player Kroxz and support Egs who was rumored to be joining appeared on faceit along with NA player K1ng and Sakura player Zorrow I dont know what will happen here Someone and Mer1tIt is likely that Someone atleast is going to Falcons same with Mer1t But there were rumors that they were both in talks with T1 for not just stage 1 but also this stage Old Ocean Becky said on discord that he will join once hes back to Korea from SEL PunkRumor says that hes back for ewc taking MFC roster slot HitoriRumored to be joining Avidity in NA as an import Thats about all the rumors that I have got I dont know any players coaches or anyone else in the

Stadium progression breakdown Ive just done the rough maths on how long a player would need to spend to go from pro all star as I completed a game and realised how little progress you gain compared to previous ranks As a preface during my previous ranks rookie pro I had a win rate of 80 winning 15 games to get from rookie pro My matchmaking times during this were roughly a minute or two After checking the combined queue time of about 68 minutes with a roughly 30 minute stadium match it would take someone with 80 winrate 75 games or about 45 hours of queuingplaying 80 winrate will presumably have a couple back to back wins so this is skewed out of their favour and would take much less time However a more accurate one is 60 winrate which is what I suspect Ill slowly drop to now that my MMR is settling and Im dropped in lobbies with GMs and top 500s At this is becomes 150 games or 90 hours Again this isnt accounting for BtB wins but at 60 Id say it matters less so That means assuming the system does not become harder and you continue to sit at 60 win rate very unlikely to go from pro legend 1 you would need to play 450 games or dedicate 270 hours to rank up in stadium Thats over half my overwatch 2 career time I routinely hit the equivalent ranks in normal ranked with nowhere near as many hours a season so why have they made these such a grind for no reason,Stadium progression breakdown I ve just done the rough maths on how long a player would need to spend to go from pro all star as I completed a game and realised how little progress you gain compared to previous ranks As a preface during my previous ranks rookie pro I had a win rate of 80 winning 15 games to get from rookie pro My matchmaking times during this were roughly a minute or two After checking the combined queue time of about 68 minutes with a roughly 30 minute stadium match it would take someone with 80 winrate 75 games or about 45 hours of queuingplaying 80 winrate will presumably have a couple back to back wins so this is skewed out of their favour and would take much less time However a more accurate one is 60 winrate which is what I suspect Ill slowly drop to now that my MMR is settling and I m dropped in lobbies with GMs and top 500s At this is becomes 150 games or 90 hours Again this is nt accounting for BtB wins but at 60 I d say it matters less so That means assuming the system does not become harder and you continue to sit at 60 win rate very unlikely to go from pro legend 1 you would need to play 450 games or dedicate 270 hours to rank up in stadium That s over half my overwatch 2 career time I routinely hit the equivalent ranks in normal ranked with nowhere near as many hours a season so why have they made these such a grind for no reason,stadium progression breakdown I ve just do the rough math on how long a player would need to spend to go from pro all star as I complete a game and realise how little progress you gain compare to previous rank as a preface during my previous rank rookie pro I have a win rate of 80 win 15 game to get from rookie pro my matchmaking time during this be roughly a minute or two after check the combine queue time of about 68 minute with a roughly 30 minute stadium match it would take someone with 80 winrate 75 game or about 45 hour of queuingplaye 80 winrate will presumably have a couple back to back win so this be skew out of their favour and would take much less time however a more accurate one be 60 winrate which be what I suspect Ill slowly drop to now that my MMR be settle and I m drop in lobby with gm and top 500 at this be become 150 game or 90 hour again this be not account for btb win but at 60 I d say it matter less so that mean assume the system do not become hard and you continue to sit at 60 win rate very unlikely to go from pro legend 1 you would need to play 450 game or dedicate 270 hour to rank up in stadium that s over half my overwatch 2 career time I routinely hit the equivalent rank in normal rank with nowhere near as many hour a season so why have they make these such a grind for no reason,stadium progression breakdown ve rough math long player need spend pro star complete game realise little progress gain compare previous rank preface previous rank rookie pro win rate 80 win 15 game rookie pro matchmaking time roughly minute check combine queue time 68 minute roughly 30 minute stadium match 80 winrate 75 game 45 hour queuingplaye 80 winrate presumably couple win skew favour time accurate 60 winrate suspect Ill slowly drop MMR settle m drop lobby gm 500 150 game 90 hour account btb win 60 d matter mean assume system hard continue sit 60 win rate unlikely pro legend 1 need play 450 game dedicate 270 hour rank stadium s half overwatch 2 career time routinely hit equivalent rank normal rank near hour season grind reason

A new hero that in my opinion may need a rework Aside from many other heroes that need to be reworked such as sojourn is Freja The fact that she can rapidly shoot her explosive arrows at a maximum of 3 times preperks 4 times postperks is insane to me The video I attached below shows a Frejas POV that I was up against using 3 of them rapidly Although she didnt hit anyone in this particular clip she did it to me and my teammates several times and the amount of damage with stacked explosive arrows its 100 instakill unless youre a tank The only reason Im using this clip is because it better displays how fast she can shoot them To those who dont play Freja every time you use Take Aim used to shoot an explosive arrow if you use Quick Dash it resets Take Aim meaning you can shoot another explosive arrows one after another far faster than waiting to reload them in between shots Freja in my opinion is already strong enough but this Its literally another junkrat but with the properties of Hanzo and thats a little too powerfulin my opinion What are your thoughts on this,A new hero that in my opinion may need a rework Aside from many other heroes that need to be reworked such as sojourn is Freja The fact that she can rapidly shoot her explosive arrows at a maximum of 3 times preperks 4 times postperks is insane to me The video I attached below shows a Frejas POV that I was up against using 3 of them rapidly Although she did nt hit anyone in this particular clip she did it to me and my teammates several times and the amount of damage with stacked explosive arrows its 100 instakill unless you re a tank The only reason I m using this clip is because it better displays how fast she can shoot them To those who do nt play Freja every time you use Take Aim used to shoot an explosive arrow if you use Quick Dash it resets Take Aim meaning you can shoot another explosive arrows one after another far faster than waiting to reload them in between shots Freja in my opinion is already strong enough but this Its literally another junkrat but with the properties of Hanzo and that s a little too powerfulin my opinion What are your thoughts on this,a new hero that in my opinion may need a rework aside from many other hero that need to be rework such as sojourn be Freja the fact that she can rapidly shoot her explosive arrow at a maximum of 3 time preperk 4 time postperk be insane to I the video I attach below show a Frejas pov that I be up against use 3 of they rapidly although she do not hit anyone in this particular clip she do it to I and my teammate several time and the amount of damage with stack explosive arrow its 100 instakill unless you re a tank the only reason I m use this clip be because it well display how fast she can shoot they to those who do not play Freja every time you use Take Aim use to shoot an explosive arrow if you use Quick Dash it reset take aim meaning you can shoot another explosive arrow one after another far fast than wait to reload they in between shot Freja in my opinion be already strong enough but this its literally another junkrat but with the property of Hanzo and that s a little too powerfulin my opinion what be your thought on this,new hero opinion need rework aside hero need rework sojourn Freja fact rapidly shoot explosive arrow maximum 3 time preperk 4 time postperk insane video attach Frejas pov use 3 rapidly hit particular clip teammate time damage stack explosive arrow 100 instakill tank reason m use clip display fast shoot play Freja time use Aim use shoot explosive arrow use Quick Dash reset aim meaning shoot explosive arrow far fast wait reload shot Freja opinion strong literally junkrat property Hanzo s little powerfulin opinion thought

Theres an exploit you can do in Stadium that allows you to get free Ult charge before the match starts So normally you cant gain ult charge this way in normal game modes because selfdamage doesnt give it But the perks that convert 100 HP to shieldsarmour dont give you it instantly and instead let the spawn room healing top you up So if you have someone healing you or you heal yourself as Moira Lucio or Soldier and spam taking and selling those two perks your healers can get a good 20 ult charge before the match starts for free per person doing this Its even stupider on Colosseo which has the small room that doesnt have the healing aura in its spawn so this is even easier to do with more potential ult gain Sharing this so word gets around and its patched,There s an exploit you can do in Stadium that allows you to get free Ult charge before the match starts So normally you ca nt gain ult charge this way in normal game modes because selfdamage does nt give it But the perks that convert 100 HP to shieldsarmour do nt give you it instantly and instead let the spawn room healing top you up So if you have someone healing you or you heal yourself as Moira Lucio or Soldier and spam taking and selling those two perks your healers can get a good 20 ult charge before the match starts for free per person doing this Its even stupider on Colosseo which has the small room that does nt have the healing aura in its spawn so this is even easier to do with more potential ult gain Sharing this so word gets around and its patched,there s an exploit you can do in Stadium that allow you to get free Ult charge before the match start so normally you can not gain ult charge this way in normal game mode because selfdamage do not give it but the perk that convert 100 HP to shieldsarmour do not give you it instantly and instead let the spawn room heal top you up so if you have someone heal you or you heal yourself as Moira Lucio or soldier and spam take and sell those two perk your healer can get a good 20 ult charge before the match start for free per person do this its even stupider on Colosseo which have the small room that do not have the heal aura in its spawn so this be even easy to do with more potential ult gain share this so word get around and its patch,s exploit Stadium allow free Ult charge match start normally gain ult charge way normal game mode selfdamage perk convert 100 HP shieldsarmour instantly instead let spawn room heal heal heal Moira Lucio soldier spam sell perk healer good 20 ult charge match start free person stupider Colosseo small room heal aura spawn easy potential ult gain share word patch

Queries regarding level resets and qp etiquette I come to you all seeking advice I apologize if this is the wrong place to ask feel free to direct me elsewhere if needed To be frank I am bad at games I used to be very good at Overwatch 1 in high school because I had a lot of free time and several friends who played it too In this time I leveled up a lot Since then I have been on hiatus for a long while and only recently really returned to Overwatch 2 Im having a lot of fun with it but it must be said that a lot of time has passed and I am very much now bad at games In the recent quick play matches I have been in I have received a frankly humorous and very varied selection of criticism and roasts I have been compared to a walking slab of meat speculated to be a quadruple amputee and told very politely to press alt f4 which I being an idiot actually tried out My current speculation is that matchmaking is sorting me with players closer to my previous skill level due to the fact that I still have that high level Is there any way I can reset my level so I can play with people that will not get their streaks ruined I feel very rude and am considering just limiting myself to vs AI but that doesnt give very much battle pass progress since most challenges dont apply I really really want those magical girl skins and am trying to farm coins to get the battle pass for free If it helps I do not touch comp with a ten foot pole but have played some stadium for the event challenges Is there a solution If not what is the proper game etiquette here Thank you all and know that I appreciate your advice TLDR can I reset my level so that I can play with players closer to my skill level If not whats the polite thing to do as someone bad at games,Queries regarding level resets and qp

Returning to competetive after 7 years So Ive been playing overwatch ever since 2016 Ive never been to PvP much since old LAN counterstrike but Ive played lots of cooperative multiplayer like Mass effect 3 and Dragon ageInquisition So team playing wasnt a foreing concept to me I went trough first iteration of competetive overwatch including the infamous Sudden Deathmechanic This was before ranks or placement matches were implemented the nonsensical 0100 rankingBut despite of this I didnt give up I kept playing around 3 years specializing tanks shield tanks in paticular I started with Winston then moved to Reinhardt Orisa back then she was a shield tank and Sigma I spent most of it in high silver always few wins away from gold What finally did kill my interest to try competetive was that I felt that I was rewarded too little for amount of work I put in and punished unreasonably for even one loss progress gained in three wins seemed neglible while a loss could almost wipe out 90 progress I had made Furthermore my worklife balance made it impossible to dedicate the time Id want to improve my skills Work took around 1012 hours of my time commutes were a PAIN so it felt like I couldnt progress anyway so there wasnt much point Season 9 2018 was my last competetive season Ever once in a while I felt like I should try to make a comeback but then whenever I did warmup on quick play I just lost any appetite for it So for 7 years I kept just playing QP doing events arcade and special game modes By Overwatch 2 introdcution of 5v5 made again wanting to try competetive but I always felt that time wasnt right Until now Now after 7 years from last competetive match and Stadium updateI felt that now is the time to return I kept my expectations modest I wanted just to get to gold whatever division because that was my goal for 3 years but always out of reach And predictions for my placements based on my MMRor at least I think they predict them on MMRseemed to be on my side How did I do Well I shattered all expectations and shot to Platinum on all ranks except DPS allthough even there I scored two tiers higher than expected Experience has been suprisingly positive When I did my Tank placements compared to how me and the other tank always seemed to be blamed to everything in 6v6 now it was nonexistant Once I got Brigitte mouthing off telling im a bronze tank with KDratio of 255 DvaI definetely had bad games in my placements but that wasnt nearly my worst Which I just replied that better a bronze tank than a feeder Brig How the hell you end up dying over 10 times asa brig anyway Some of it probably is the new score system instead of pointless medals of OW1 So tanks arent blamed as often to be as they used to Now playing as DPS it was even less than that I was allowed to misplay and no one seemed to care I wasnt even once blamed of anything which I kinda find weird given that DPS is my least played and weakest role Not by much but still I was once asked to switch pretty politely even but otherwise no one seemed to much care Entirely different story in support though Despite that it somehow ended up my highest rank there was more blamers there than two roles combined and always DPS players They not only demanded to be pocketed but outright expected it even if they played in zero angles they expected to be bailed out and demanded that I switch where as doing nothing to adapt themselves This was still minority of what it used to be but still notable Something else I noticed was almost total absent of voice comms but then again as I play in europe thats always been bit sparser Now open Qdamn that was a mess Of ten placement matches we had six leavers 2 on other side 4 on my side I still somehow ended up in plat What I also noticed which might be due to recent compdrives is that there are A LOT of players what I call dim diamonds players who have been diamonds inprevious season but have deranked all the way to plat according to those who had their profiles public What I was suprised that there was even masters there Maybe Blizzard should seriously contemplate Derank protections in the future for drives I know that idea is High risk high rewardbut Im not sure if deranking a masterlevel player to plat so that they can stomp everyone on their way to diamond is good for anyone But biggest change Ive noticed is in my attitude Before going competetive just felt stressfull but now im actually more enjoying it Maybe its because I ended up overshooting my goals maybe because QP has starting to develop as sweaty comp or maybe it is because I now try to make something out of the losses Whenever I notice that the game in QP or Comp isnt being possible to win I just start to focus on maximizing my own stats trying just stay alive as long as possible start to try new characters that sort of thing Maybe it is all of this Or maybe it is just because my life finally seems to be progressing somewhere I was saddled with a job that not only took lot of time was monotone and repetetive The pay was decent but I didnt seem to be going anywhere Now Im studying for a new profession entirely railroadtrack worker if you can believe it and I finally feel that Im going somewhere Maybe this is reflecting to everything im doing now Who knows Just feels like Im progressing So Im suprised so far everything seems to have worked out well Stadium is kinda chaotic but its also fun Its easy actually to forget that it is a competetive mode All in all im glad that I chose this time to come back and I look forward to see where this goes next,Returning to competetive after 7 years So I ve been playing overwatch ever since 2016 I ve never been to PvP much since old LAN counterstrike but I ve played lots

Concerns about Dive Stadium and Winstons addition So right now we technically have the ability to have a dive comp but in practice we really dont In a couple of seasons well have Winston be added the key enabler of dive Why am I concerned Well You cant swap And dive is MISERABLE to play into on a lot of heroes To be honest its miserable to play into as anything but a dive mirrorand even dive mirrors sometimes dedicated enablers who are also victim heroes like Ana and Zen but thats another discussion entirely Yes there are ways to play into it even on the heroes who do the worst into dive but its not an enjoyable experience And again you cant swap and youll be stuck in it for multiple rounds Combine that with how small these maps are in stadium meaning that dive will counter non dive and non brawl comps even harder and brawl will counter dive even harder making balancing dive a very difficult thing to do in relation to the comps its countered by and the comps its strong into It

my concerns are in order of importance in my opinion 1 The player experience for nondive players into dive 2 The general balance of dive in stadium I think its definitely possible for them to do

So we know Stadium is more toxic than normal and that the best solution is to just mute people What are some behaviors you use to souse out problematic people and mute them while being open to others Obviously its not viable to come up with a code of ethics for people to follow to not be toxic Conversely however Just mute everyone can stand to be refined given the importance of coordination in competitive settings So Im thinking What are some behaviors in Overwatch that are red flags for toxicity 1 Making demands instead of requests at the start of a match If I see join vc thats purely imperative a red flag to not join please join vc is safer since theyre at least being mindful about manners when time allows Similar is when a teammate tells another one to switch a sign of micromanaging others 2 Interpreting declarative statements as demands or interpreting the use of periods as aggression If I type Making callouts in vc that does not demand that anyone joins and is meant to imply that Im fine with that outcome A response of who asked to anything purely informational is always worth a mute 3 People with firstround criticisms First round is just spicy normal Overwatch and is a very poor indicator of longterm performance Its okay to say what youre struggling with like Orisa predicted my power or Their Soldier keeps flanking me The people that are like gg our Rein is feeding or our Cass cant aim however have some idea of a teammate cemented in their mind that theyre unwilling to change Mute 4 People with nonconstructive secondround criticisms Pointing out mistakes is always best paired with either an explanation of why its a mistake or some way to fix it Second round is still a bit early for indicators of longterm performance but if were like 5 away from the mercy rule being triggered next round Ill try to figure out how to resolve teammates issues Of course any teammate that complains about other teammates performance without trying to help them gets a mute Naturally Im probably gonna get some people declaring my snap judgements lack of forgiveness and pompoussounding prose here to be redflag behavior but this discussion is all about finding reasons to preemptively mute people so to them I say Youve found your reason to mute me,So we know Stadium is more toxic than normal and that the best solution is to just mute people What are

Lifeweaver Reworked to be a pokedive carry I was bored so I reworked lifeweaver to be engaging and fun Preface Current strengths High vertical mobility good for maps like hollywood paraiso numbani Good spam for chokesshields Enables dpstanks to take high ground although many already have this ability Consistent healing at a decently long range especially since it can go through barriers and enemies still wont outperform ana and bap at close ranges single target only Grippies for reinhardtother low mobility heroes Issues Lack of kit synergy can do a lot of different things spam poke dive Life grip more consistently harms your team rather than assisting them aside from rein or zarya forces you to reset rather than be aggressive Platform doesnt work as a standalone initiator its easy to rotate around and often gets stuck on payloads doesnt provide cover Main weapon works against the rest of his kit unable to consistently focus targets while his platform helps poke dps life grip helps dive characters treedash almost no utility just encourages running away Hes not just a low skill character with specific weaknesses like mercyroadhogmoira hes a purely reactionary support with little opportunity to make plays by himself Fixes Keep him as a main healer make him a tactician support who enables his dps and tanks to engage Move away from passive playstyle keep it more active Give him more utility Make his main weaponheal feel more responsive and targeted Make his life grip and platform more engaging for allies Changes Thorn volley Lower the fire rate increase damage and accuracy maintain the same dps This change allows lifeweaver to more effectively weave in dps between his healing blossoms One or two thorns dealing burst damage like mei icicle are more effective than a wave of inaccurate thorns that only get value after using them for a long time Petal Platform Allies heal 20hp per second same as syms shield battery perk while on platform lingers 15 seconds after they get off Platform is smaller but petal edges are raised slightly to give more cover Lasts until its broken still lowers when not used Increase the cooldown to 15 seconds when broken Possible perkchange Gains a second charge Possible Perkchange Platform gives a 20 damage boost instead of healing This change allows the platform to be used more offensively by dps but unable to be used for the whole team Also allows tanks life winston or to stage on it giving them the ability to poke and create space from a safe angle The platform soaks damage and heals until broken giving anyone who uses it a lot of mitigation between poking or diving He can also use it himself when his dps are out of resources he can effectively pressure using his increased accuracy and damage Healing blossom Lower the maximum healing down to 70 Since platform now heals and he deals more damage he requires less healing to be effective Automatically charges pressing secondary fire instantly sends it charges the same when using thorn volley No more carpel tunnel when playing this character oml Life grip Instead of instantly gripping the target to lifeweavers location instead it creates a tether between lw and his ally The ally will gain a small flower over there head indicated on their HUD and an option to press interact to pull themselves back towards lifeweavers location Tether lasts around 10 seconds same as talus rune from paladins if unused when it expires 50 of the cooldown will be refunded Same cooldown Requires constant line of sight some leniency round corners will be given Moving too far around a corner for more than 3 seconds will break the tether partially refunding the cooldown Allies with the tether can press crouch to use Symettras teleporter Possible addendum Lifeweaver can also press the ability again to instantly pull his teammate back Possible perkchange Tethered allies gain a small amount of healing per second Possible perkchange Allies now teleport back to lifeweaver no longer expires from being out of LOS This change gives lifeweavers ally the agency to decide on how they want to use life grip Not only does it provide lifeweaver more utility to his team lifeweaver can now be more intentional with who he tethers giving his allies indication that he will support them for when they want to engage This can also be used in combination with his platform allowing a dps to take an aggressive angle and after getting a kill instantly grip back to their team Obviously best used for dive characters like genji or winston but also enables low mobility heroes like rein or zarya to be more aggressive and overextend with an escape Also gives lws dash some use for maintaining that line of sight with your ally Tree of Life Lower the duration to 10 seconds Radius increased to 20 meters Initial healing lowered no longer creates over health Now slows enemies inside ramping up from 3060 slow over 5 seconds Possible perkchange Enemies caught in the ult for more than 5 seconds are put to sleep for 3 seconds With life weavers current passive playstyle trees main usage has been for when lw is getting dove So this change gives it more utility outside of being used as a budget mei wall The tree of life uses artificial pollen spores to lull the targets slowing them over the course of its duration The ultimate can be used more aggressively to prevent an enemy team from rotating or disengaging allowing certain tanks to profit off of stragglers caught in the open while gaining the upper hand from the healing received Perks Minor perks Life grip tether heals for 15hps Petal platform gives 15 dmg boost Major perks Life grip no longer expires around corners instantly teleports players duration decreased to 7 seconds Tree of life puts enemies to sleep for 3 seconds after 5 seconds Conclusion Healing and damage numbers could be changed around Still not sure about petal platform but giving it a flat damage boost is scary in combination with a mercy Let me know

Shuffling Sombras power budget into mobility and uptime in fights A Rework Concept Gonna go straight to the pointnumbers and will add thoughts and theory at the end No this isnt a Support Sombra

shields Doing so doesnt incur a cooldown penalty on Sombra NOTE An argument could be made for Hack to disable Ability 1 Shift instead of Ability 2 but this targets most heroes mobility and survivability tools which DISPROPORTIONATELY affects almost every tank Meanwhile locking Ability 2 has more impact on fightswinging Support cooldowns but is less oppressive for a good portion of the cast For this reason I think Hack would be much less frustrating to much more people if it locks out Ability 2 instead Also locking Ball out of Roll for 3s is OW1 all over again but with A2 Doomfist

Zenyatta Orb of Harmony A1 Orb of Discord A2 # THEORY AND CONCEPT TLDR and can skip if uninterested Sombra needs a rebalancing of her power budget and the recent controversies surrounding her ban rate and community perception betray that she needs it fast If youre somehow out of the loop regarding this I recommend watching Questrons video on the issue which was one of the biggest contributing factors to this rework idea PROBLEMS WITH OLDER ITERATIONS Each previous attempt at a rework has targeted different areas of Sombras power appeal and accessibility both of playing her with her and against her The first one in OW1 that made Stealth and TP infinite made her much easier to use but her staying power in fights and overall uptime were severely affected The early OW2 rework took power out of Hacks CC and gave it to her gun but it made Hack a clunky and spammy mess which made Sombra extremely dependent on this ability to have impact causing the enemy team to be constantly hacked over and over again Meanwhile the issues of her uptime and ease of engagedisengage were never addressed After the release of Kiriko and the nerf of Hacks damage bonus she was essentially a throw pick but still a very irritating one to fight Then came the two Virus reworks These made Sombra have less survivability but with much higher burst damage a somewhat cheesy kill combo that required much less skill to pull off than other flankers and worse of all the first one still didnt address how her kit encouraged low uptime problems The latest rework made her extremely inflexible in how she functions and in exchange gave her even more burst damage which greatly increases the frustration of fighting an enemy that pops out of nowhere and deletes you before you can react thus compounding the already preexisting frustrations of Sombras softCC and escape options and making playing support into her feel like Dead by Daylight for many players And while her uptime issue was sort of addressed her staying power in fights was neutered even more by lowering her HP and giving her no way to sustain herself during a brawl or dive This makes Sombra an allornothing hero which imo has only increased the frustration of fighting her and playing her REWORK CONCEPTS AND REASONINGS This rework aims to address exactly that With Translocator going back to being a uniquely designed escape tool but limiting the time it remains active this promotes Sombra to use it as a repositioning tool that she needs to carefully plan in order to use effectively The limited duration also discourages simply leaving it on a health pack 50mts away from the fight and promotes a more active use to cover multiple offangles at once using it to engage in a dive or using it to return to the safety of your supports The two charges are there to provide more flexibility for mindgames and also an assurance that Sombra can stay in a fight or return to it briskly if shes pushed out as well as giving her the ability to go for deeper flanks if needed However the longer cooldown on it means that if shes forced to use both charges back to back she has a very long vulnerability period of 8 to 16s Another change that aims to shuffle Sombras tools is the change to Stealth Rather than being her engage tool Stealth now is meant to be an escape and midfight sustain tool Only 3s is not really enough to cross an entire battlefield and the healing effect promotes Sombra to use it to reposition and reengage quickly midduelfight rather than hide and be a rat for most of the match Ofc the much longer cooldown of 12s pushes it way more into this function filling the same ability niche of Deflect or Recall while also allowing Sombra to use it to cross short sightlines unnoticed if she needs to Finally Hack locking out only one ability is meant to greatly reduce the overall frustration of the CC but in return for this massive nerf it also locks it out for a much longer time and in turn also has a much longer cooldown Importantly this makes it so Hack interacts more variably with the overall cast with some heroes not even being affected by its base version like Venture and perkless Bastion Its also meant to only disable more offensive tank abilities rather than defensive ones so that Hack can still hinder a tanks push without leaving them completely vulnerable as it does currently The one exception is Doomfist Who gets cucked extra hard by this change although he still retains the ability to use Slam or Punch to escape an interrupted Block However the biggest aim of this Hack change is to counter important support and DPS cooldowns Nade Suzu Orb Lifegrip Immortality Res Amp Ice Wall and Discord are all disabled for a lengthy time which can help an ally make an offensive play with less risk while also allowing support players to still fight back against Sombra if shes using it to vs them personally Ana can still sleep her Kiriko Moira LW and Mercy can still run away Brig can knock Sombra back etc Biggest winners of this change are Ball Sigma and Rein while the biggest losers are arguably the playdenying supports and specific DPS landing a hack on Tracer denies Recall for 3s for example while Cassidy is unable to use Flashbang Through the Minor Perks Hack regains the ability to cancel channeled ults and abilities meant to allow Sombra the counterplay to particular heroes that she currently is known for while still not being nearly as oppressive in the overall lockout timer Remember too that Hacks cooldown is half as longer as current live However she gives up Firewall which gives her a pretty hefty amount of midfight sustain and survivability that allows her to be much more aggressive making the use of a universal interrupt Hack more of a greedy option Finally White Hat is controversial among Sombra players and I definitely think it needs more power to justify its existence Making it a crazy save tool is adequate imo since it doesnt reduce the overall longer cooldown of this version of Hack Since Hack is less universally useful as well using it in this way gives Sombra a lot more versatility in how she chooses her perks if no one in the enemy team is particularly worth hacking due to their A2s This overall redistribution of power is capped by increasing Sombras SMG damage Without Virus to pad her DPS and poke she needs more damage to function in her role Currently Virus shooting without hack comes to a DPS of around 179 damage with an initial burst of 35 Putting her gun damage squarely at 180 gives her similar DPS that is 100 reliant on her aim but with no burst which is still decently high for a DPS However dont forget that Invisibility is a precious escape and selfsustain tool here so no more pouncing from the shadows to delete you in one second Additionally no Virus means she cant endlessly poke from infinite range to drain resources and put pressure Overall this concept is aimed at greatly increasing her midfight survivability selfsustain and mobility while also lowering the overall painpoints and frequency of her CC and invisibility both of which get added options to make them more versatile and adaptive to whatever team comp Sombra is fighting And of course needless to say if any of these ideas were ever implemented ALL SPECIFIC NUMBERS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE FOR BETTER BALANCE This includes

Resurrect A2 Moira Fade A1 Biotic Orb a2 Zenyatta Orb of Harmony A1 Orb of Discord A2 THEORY and CONCEPT TLDR and can skip if uninterested Sombra need a rebalancing of her power budget and the recent controversy surround her ban rate and community perception betray that she need it fast if you re somehow out of the loop regard this I recommend watch questron video on the issue which be one of the big contributing factor to this rework idea problems with old iteration each previous attempt at a rework have target different area of Sombras power appeal and accessibility both of play she with she and against she the first one in OW1 that make Stealth and TP infinite make she much easy to use but her stay power in fight and overall uptime be severely affect the early OW2 rework take power out of Hacks CC and give it to her gun but it make Hack a clunky and spammy mess which make Sombra extremely dependent on this ability to have impact cause the enemy team to be constantly hack over and over again meanwhile the issue of her uptime and ease of engagedisengage be never address after the release of Kiriko and the nerf of Hacks damage bonus she be essentially a throw pick but still a very irritate one to fight then come the two Virus rework these make Sombra have less survivability but with much high burst damage a somewhat cheesy kill combo that require much less skill to pull off than other flanker and bad of all the first one still do not address how her kit encourage low uptime problem the late rework make she extremely inflexible in how she function and in exchange give she even more burst damage which greatly increase the frustration of fight an enemy that pop out of nowhere and delete you before you can react thus compound the already preexist frustration of Sombras softCC and escape option and make play support into her feel like Dead by Daylight for many player and while her uptime issue be sort of address her staying power in fight be neuter even more by lower her HP and give she no way to sustain herself during a brawl or dive this make Sombra an allornothing hero which imo have only increase the frustration of fight she and play her REWORK CONCEPTS and reasoning this rework aim to address exactly that with Translocator go back to be a uniquely design escape tool but limit the time it remain active this promote Sombra to use it as a reposition tool that she need to carefully plan in order to use effectively the limited duration also discourage simply leave it on a health pack 50mts away from the fight and promote a more active use to cover multiple offangle at once use it to engage in a dive or use it to return to the safety of your support the two charge be there to provide more flexibility for mindgame and also an assurance that Sombra can stay in a fight or return to it briskly if she s push out as well as give she the ability to go for deep flank if need however the long cooldown on it mean that if she s force to use both charge back to back she have a very long vulnerability period of 8 to 16 another change that aim to shuffle Sombras tool be the change to Stealth rather than be her engage tool Stealth now be mean to be an escape and midfight sustain tool only 3s be not really enough to cross an entire battlefield and the healing effect promote Sombra to use it to reposition and reengage quickly midduelfight rather than hide and be a rat for most of the match ofc the much long cooldown of 12s push it way more into this function fill the same ability niche of Deflect or Recall while also allow Sombra to use it to cross short sightline unnoticed if she need to finally Hack lock out only one ability be mean to greatly reduce the overall frustration of the cc but in return for this massive nerf it also lock it out for a much long time and in turn also have a much long cooldown importantly this make it so Hack interact more variably with the overall cast with some hero not even be affect by its base version like Venture and perkless Bastion Its also mean to only disable more offensive tank ability rather than defensive one so that Hack can still hinder a tank push without leave they completely vulnerable as it do currently the one exception be Doomfist who get cucke extra hard by this change although he still retain the ability to use Slam or Punch to escape an interrupted block however the big aim of this Hack change be to counter important support and dps cooldown Nade Suzu Orb Lifegrip Immortality Res Amp Ice Wall and Discord be all disabled for a lengthy time which can help an ally make an offensive play with less risk while also allow support player to still fight back against Sombra if she s use it to vs they personally Ana can still sleep her Kiriko Moira LW and Mercy can still run away Brig can knock Sombra back etc big winner of this change be Ball Sigma and Rein while the big loser be arguably the playdenying support and specific DPS land a hack on Tracer deny Recall for 3s for example while Cassidy be unable to use Flashbang through the Minor Perks Hack regain the ability to cancel channel ult and ability mean to allow Sombra the counterplay to particular hero that she currently be know for while still not be nearly as oppressive in the overall lockout timer remember too that hack cooldown be half as long as current live however she give up firewall which give she a pretty hefty amount of midfight sustain and survivability that allow she to be much more aggressive making the use of a universal interrupt Hack more of a greedy option finally White Hat be controversial among Sombra player and I definitely think it need more power to justify its existence make it a crazy save tool be adequate imo since it do not reduce the overall long cooldown of this version of Hack since Hack be less universally useful as well use it in this way give Sombra a lot more versatility in how she choose her perk if no one in the enemy team be particularly worth hack due to their a2s this overall redistribution of power be cap by increase Sombras SMG damage without Virus to pad her dps and poke she need more damage to function in her role currently Virus shoot without hack come to a dps of around 179 damage with an initial burst of 35 put her gun damage squarely at 180 give her similar dps that be 100 reliant on her aim but with no burst which be still decently high for a DPS however do not forget that Invisibility be a precious escape and selfsustain tool here so no more pounce from the shadow to delete you in one second Additionally no Virus mean she can not endlessly poke from infinite range to drain resource and put pressure Overall this concept be aim at greatly increase her midfight survivability selfsustain and mobility while also lower the overall painpoint and frequency of her cc and invisibility both of which get add option to make they more versatile and adaptive to whatever team comp Sombra be fight and of course needless to say if any of these idea be ever implement all SPECIFIC number be subject to change for better balance this include cooldown damage and sustain value,shuffle

You arent building Stadium Rein right Theres a lot of discussion about how hard it can get to burst Rein down with builds focusing solely on his survivability when I feel like people are ignoring his most powerful kit The crux of this is Gloomgauntlet because critically his hammer counts as melee This means for 9500 you get 50 armor 25 weapon damage since his only weapon is melee and max health healing on every hit Stack this with tons of weapon lifesteal attack power and attack speed with Smashing and Feel the Burn and theres little anything can do to challenge you once you get in range The only character that maybe stands a chance is a perfectly kitted Reaper but even then its close Your swings go north of 150 damage per hit healing you for nearly the same and shredding through the enemy tank very very easily No need to spec into tons of health and shield perks just grab Gloomgauntlet and Nebula Conduit and youre good to go Wilhelmwagen is a fine third power but honestly once you have the first two youre golden,You are nt building Stadium Rein right There s a lot of discussion about how hard it can get to burst Rein down with builds focusing solely on his survivability when I feel like people are ignoring his most powerful kit The crux of this is Gloomgauntlet because critically his hammer counts as melee This means for 9500 you get 50 armor 25 weapon damage since his only weapon is melee and max health healing on every hit Stack this with tons of weapon lifesteal attack power and attack speed with Smashing and Feel the Burn and there s little anything can do to challenge you once you get in range The only character that maybe stands a chance is a perfectly kitted Reaper but even then its close Your swings go north of 150 damage per hit healing you for nearly the same and shredding through the enemy tank very very easily No need to spec into tons of health and shield perks just grab Gloomgauntlet and Nebula Conduit and you re good to go Wilhelmwagen is a fine third power but honestly once you have the first two you re golden,you be not build Stadium Rein right there s a lot of discussion about how hard it can get to burst Rein down with build focus solely on his survivability when I feel like people be ignore his most powerful kit the crux of this be Gloomgauntlet because critically his hammer count as melee this mean for 9500 you get 50 armor 25 weapon damage since his only weapon be melee and max health healing on every hit Stack this with ton of weapon lifesteal attack power and attack speed with Smashing and feel the Burn and there s little anything can do to challenge you once you get in range the only character that maybe stand a chance be a perfectly kitte reaper but even then its close your swing go north of 150 damage per hit heal you for nearly the same and shred through the enemy tank very very easily no need to spec into ton of health and shield perk just grab Gloomgauntlet and Nebula Conduit and you re good to go Wilhelmwagen be a fine third power but honestly once you have the first two you re golden,build Stadium Rein right s lot discussion hard burst Rein build focus solely survivability feel like people ignore powerful kit crux Gloomgauntlet critically hammer count melee mean 9500 50 armor 25 weapon damage weapon melee max health healing hit Stack ton weapon lifesteal attack power attack speed Smashing feel Burn s little challenge range character maybe stand chance perfectly kitte reaper close swing north 150 damage hit heal nearly shred enemy tank easily need spec ton health shield perk grab Gloomgauntlet Nebula Conduit good Wilhelmwagen fine power honestly golden
Congratulations Blizzard you ruined Roadhog again Now hold on a minute reddit dont crucify me just yet Im not gonna go ahead and claim that Roadhog is overpowered in a highlevel competetive enviroment Thats just not true but I will explain why Hog has become such a pain in the ass in Quick Play again Let me be clear Hog has never been fun to deal with Getting hooked never FEELS good even before season 15 In the grand scheme of things however he was manageable His hook has always been extreme value for an ability with such a short cooldown But it was balanced by the fact that literally every OTHER aspect of his kit was awful He did no damage unless he had his full HookPig Pen combo ready could set up the pen and his his hook Since he lacked a shield lacked mobility and had a huge hitbox he sucked at keeping himself alive As soon as he stepped out in the open he got ganked by the entire enemy team and denied What this meant is that he very rarely got a good chance to get great value for his hook because it was so easy to pressure him with damage or outright kill him You saw Hog in maybe 1 of 20 matches which made made him manageable The first change they did was in the S15 mid season patch when they increased his HP by 50 Completely unescessary but it didnt really change anything The real change came with the launch of season 16 This added Hogs infamous perk which gives him 50 overcharging Take a Breather charge just by triggering Pig Pen Getting the charge is so easy that he effectively has a permament 50 charge This means that literally any idiot can sustain through almost any teamfight and as long as you can hit at least 25 of your hooks youll get absolute monster value Its so easy and its so hard to die Because playing as Hog is free value galore you now encounter him in maybe 50 of your quickplay games Hes also a fairly common pick in ranked in gold and below where most of the playerbase is situated And man as a tank main I am so very tired of fighting this invincible painthuffer Oh and I forgot to mention the perk which lets him heal his allies around him Making his team harder to kill was literally 50 of the reason people hated Prime Mauga and his stupid Cardiac Overdrive So that was just an absolutely fantastic idea of Blizzard to add that to the game,Congratulations Blizzard you ruined Roadhog again Now hold on a minute reddit

My Issues with the game I have been playing overwatch for a very long time since the beta of this game I have reached Diamonds on all roles have peaked at Masters 3 for DPS My issues from the game became apparent when I started getting into matches while on plat and noticed that the rank range is a bit too far off from each other I once had a plat 2 and a silver 2 in a lobby with me and this keeps happening to my matches where I would have teammates who are in plat as well who play like this is the first match of their life or seem like absolute brand new players Ive had many games where players would be oblivious to game mechanics like doomfist gauntlet charge up and zarya bubble charge while they are in plat My matches now for the past few months has been completely one sided and it never feels like a balanced match making Having encountered teams in groups while my while team being mostly solos This does not seem fair as having teams in groups to communicate with each other is at such an advantage while the solos do not have this opportunity directly It would seem more fair to have matches that advocate solo teams vs solo teams and groups vs groups instead however this does not seem like the case Another issue I am having is that I have noticed something that seems unfair in the game where if you had capped the point first and has brought it high in numbers like 20 the team that over takes the point seems to have a higher rate of percentage where after losing one team fight against the overtaking team they would easily reach 80 with the same amount of time it takes for the first capped team to reach 20 This does not seem fair to a degree Last issue I am having is that the ban system seems to be randomized to some degree I had many occasions when my team would ban 2 heros collectively but the minority vote was pushed into the final choice which does not make sense I am on a 30 game plus losing streak and these issues are very hard to deal with at times,My

ana doesnt work in stadium atleast not correctly So Ive been messing around in the stadium practice range and Ive come across multiple cases of Anas perks just not working and Im surprised I havent seen or heard anybody talk about it some that I found are when you have the powers comfy cloudaoe sleep and dreamysleep heals allies and the perk lethal dose100 dmg sleeps it wont proc lethal dose in fact your sleeps no longer do dmg including the base 5 dmg that its supposed to normally do but that only happens when you combine both powers together if you have 1 or the other your sleeps Will do dmg including the extra from lethal dose idk why it glitches when you have both for sleep regimen from my experience it just straight up doesnt work it WILL give you the base 50 hp that it gives just for buying it but the other part where you apply sleep to an enemy GAIN 10 hp up to 150 hp just doesnt work ive tried sleeping multiple enemies b4 buying the power and gained nothing but the normal 50 hp and ive tried buying it b4 ive slept anyone and it gave me no extra hp other than the normal 50 when i sleep people I have heard some people buy it in a actual game and it give some hp but its never worked for me and it only gave the extra hp for enemies slept b4 buying it and gave no extra hp from sleeping enemies after buying it I have found though that it does HEAL 10 hp per slept target but that should not be how it works and if that is how its intended then that wouldnt make any sense because how are you supposed to sleep 15 enemies with a SINGULAR sleep dart Another one I found is the perk double dosage sleeping an enemy affected by biotic grenade gives 35 of your sleep cooldown back Ive found it works really weird and for some things it doesnt work the way it should comparatively 1st it DOES work when you anti an enemy and sleep them including when you sleep multiple enemies with comfy cloudwhich is how it should work no complaints there though the cooldown refund doesnt stack with multiple enemies slept from one sleep but thats probably a good thing Now here is where it gets weird if you kill them with the sleep it WILL NOT give you the cooldown refund meaning it has negative synergy when you pair it with the lethal dose perk another weird thing is that if you add the dreamy power up and hit your allies it thankfully does work but only kind of you HAVE TO directly hit them with the sleep even when you add the comfy cloud power which IS NOT how it works when you sleep enemies you DO NOT HAVE TO directly hit enemies that are affected by biotic grenade to get the cooldown refund but you DO HAVE TO directly hit allies that are affected by biotic grenade to get the cooldown refund which if you cannot tell makes no sense at all the final one I found is with the power up home remedybiotic grenade grants over health equal to 100 of its healing this one is not as crazy as the other points all i found is that the over health is only applied when your allies are yellowincreased healing input which I dont think thats how it should be there shouldnt be a duration to the over health especially when you look at how the power up is worded as it does not explicitly state that you can only have the over health while you are currently affected by biotic grenade I say this because there is a perk called IV drip that does explicitly state while AFFECTED by biotic grenade ana gains 100 over health this makes me really confused as to why they are worded differently even though they work the exact same way now they probably just worded the power up wrong but personally i hope its not supposed to work like that and the over health is supposed to be permanent or at least have a longer separate durationobviously the over health you grant shouldnt be able to stack on top of each other cause that would be to broken Im not saying this to dog on the game I just want people to know about this so the devs know to fix it because i havent heard anyone say anything about how ana doesnt work correctly,ana does nt work in stadium atleast not correctly So I ve been messing around in the stadium practice range and I ve come across

Possible New Characters So Im sure by now everyone has played enough to at least catch glimpses of all the various characters in the background in the form of paintings statues etc albeit we cant really make custom games to get a closer look yet which character would you like to see Id have to say Im interested in Titus he could be Reinhardts rival or old friend similar to Captain America Winter Soldier but instead of being a giant rocket Hammer wielding jet boosted 1 ton pickup with a bulletlaserrocket proof window meanwhile Titus has a much smaller and more compact Barrier that makes even Brigittes seem large in comparison mostly blocking chest shots from a general front angle whereas positioning it properly by looking up at an angle could block headshots similar to a Phalanx vs an arrow storm like in the movie 300 They would be a light HP character similar to Freja and Tracer having their physique mostly attuned for agility and accuracy with short range spear thrusts and the ability to throw and retrieve it while utilizing a short sword up close maybe a perk that adds a chain and allows him to pull himself toward an enemy if he spears them like hog hook but in reverse basically what Im trying to say is Pantheon from League of Legends I guess Or maybe have him be a tank alternative to Rein that functions more like Lance from Vainglory albeit that guy used a Lance not a spear Either way it would be cool to see a new melee type character preferably for the DPS because Genji is lonely at the top and Venture barely counts but I do count her nonetheless Shes at rock bottom so to speak Although if we make him like Pantheon we might consider a different ultimate maybe the ability to recall his spear after each throw for a short time automatically refreshing its throw cooldown in the process so he can just wildly throw spears like a madman and blot out the sun in Stadium mode,Possible New Characters So I m sure by now everyone has played enough to at

New to competitive stadium blues EDIT My gf asked me to queue a few stad games with her and I had a lot of fun this time Maybe I just dont like solo queueing that mode Thank you for your feedback Ill remember its just about doing my best and having fun And Ill take a break if I start panicking and it ruins the experience I have about 250 hrs in Overwatch 2 Its my first shooter and my aim isnt very good so I tend to stick with very straightforward accessibletobeginners characters mercy Juno and soldier are my most played When I first played stadium and got placed in rookie 3 or 4 I thought it was really fun but still engaging enough for me to break a sweat sometimes Ive since been placed contender 3 for support and I hate playing stadium now Ive tried a few other characters but I end up just playing support and picking Juno or Mercy bc theyre what Im best at Even then my healing and damage are ass and I feel like my team is carrying me Im really bringing them down Since Ive ranked up I always have the lowest amount of cash is that equivalent to how much value you had in that round and more often than not the least healing out of the supports Ive since looked into best builds that would support my team comps and my style of playing but I dont know if its helped at all No ones said anything to me but I know I could be doing more for my team My poor mood affects my decisionmaking so I end up doing stupid things like going for reckless rezzes or panicking and using my movement ability just to save myself rather than to help get my teammates out Is this just what its like to play in higher ranks higher just meaning higher than the lowest which is what Im used to I feel so miserable and guilty all the time and it makes me not want to play the game anymore If its just me and this isnt a normal feeling what can I do to stay calm during matches and support my team more,New to competitive stadium blues EDIT My gf asked me to queue a few stad games with her and I had a

Lifeweaver is in a better spot now but is there still something missing from his kit Hey guys So I was wonderingLifeweaver has received a lot of buffs and hes in a better spot overall But is there still something missing from his kit I think theres still a lack of consistency between his weapon swap for healing and damage Take other supports as examples Kirikos autorecharge healing has a 09second window and during that time you can throw two kunais with no real downtime Baptiste similar to Kiriko can alternate between healing and damage by using his healing recovery time to land two shots Moira and Illari can heal and deal damage instantly when switching between their primary and secondary fire while managing their healing resources Juno and Ana can both heal or damage simply by aiming at allies or enemies Brig Zen and Lucio all provide AoE passive or abilitybased healing while dealing damage at the same time The only supports left with separate weaponswapping mechanics are Mercy and Lifeweaver But Mercy compensates with her damage boost as a secondary fire Now Lifeweaver on the other hand has to manually prepare his healing every time His kit lacks fluidity between damage and healing Hes also the only hero in the game whose inactive weapon reloads slower than if you were actively using it25 seconds when swapping vs 15 seconds manually That just feels unnecessary So I thought why not bring his weapons more in line with other supports My goal is to minimize downtime between damage and healing while keeping the feel of charging his heals Here are my ideas still open to suggestions Healing Blossom 1 Passive charging now only begins when Thorn Volley is active and during its use the charge time remains the same at 115 seconds 2 Ammo is only consumed if the projectile is released 3 Automatic reload time for the inactive weapon reduced from 25s to 15s 4 Weapon swap animation smoothed out and made more responsive Why 1 These changes promote a more aggressive Lifeweaver playstyle Like Kiriko or Bap the time you would take to charge a heal can now be used to deal some damage which keeps things consistent 2 Theres no reason to spend ammo if no projectile is fired 3 Some may suggest infinite ammo for BlossomI considered it but for now I prefer giving players a bit of skill expression through reload management Still open to changing this 4 The healingdamage swap feels clunky because its not tied to a truly primarysecondary fire so smoother animation is something that the animators needs to ajust These proposed changes aim to make Lifeweavers gameplay more fluid and rewarding allowing him to better balance healing and damage without feeling clunky By promoting a more aggressive playstyle and addressing issues like ammo consumption and weapon swapping we can make Lifeweaver feel more consistent and responsive in combat Other kit suggestions Healing Tree Blossom Dash Now delivers instant burst healing Based on the wiki and workshop data theres a 03s HoT in healing Switching to instant burst could improve responsiveness as a QoL change Life Grip Now cleanses negative effects Honestly this should be in his base kit not just as a perk Petal Platform Crouching on an idle platform no longer activates it Interact button no longer destroys ithold the activation button for 03s to remove it Interact button now makes platform descend even with a player on it Idle platforms can now be raised by pressing Interact no one needs to step on it and it remains in the air until interact is pressed again in this case These changes aim to make the platform more strategic and bring back tactics like lifting turrets or Winstons bubble without breaking current mechanics and improving general controlNote that these changes do not change the way it is activated and deactivated activates when someone goes up deactivates when someone step out of it but just adds an extra control to the abiliity Tree of Life First pulse healing increased from 150 to 180 To keep up with the general HP buff and stay consistent with the 90 HP per pulse Perk adjustments Removed Cleansing Grasp Lifeweaving New Minor Perk Care from Afar Increases the range of Life Grip and Healing Blossom by 35 Simple but very useful New Major Perk Rejuvenating Platform Petal Platform reloads allies ammo and grants infinite ammo while standing on it This is meant to give the platform more utility Initially I thought about increasing fire rate but this idea feels more unique Superbloom rework Instead of needing to hit 20 projectiles to trigger an explosion now every 20th projectile is explosive dealing small AoE damage 2m radius This makes it more consistent and effective against grouped enemies or objects Thats it Sorry for the

Just had a dream about a sniper Moira perks as well as other stuff So first of all there was a sniper Moira build with perks that allowed her to suck with RMB from really far away and then she had a double ball but it worked like selecting the type first and then clicking again to shoot first one than another ball of the same type so either two healing or two damage and then would fly faster so you could basically snipe out the widow ah also her shift allowed her to basically move to any position on the map even outside of the sky box basically fade turned into godmode And then I just woke up and thought that life weaver could grab two people with his e instead of his seed like click twice if wanted to grab two people like select two people and then grab them both,Just had a dream about a sniper Moira perks as well as other stuff So first of all there was a sniper Moira build with perks that allowed her to suck with RMB from really far away and then she had a double ball but it worked like selecting the type first and then clicking again to shoot first one than another ball of the same type so either two healing or two damage and then would fly faster so you could basically snipe out the widow ah also her shift allowed her to basically move to any position on the map even outside of the sky box basically fade turned into godmode And then I just woke up and thought that life weaver could grab two people with his e instead of his seed like click twice if wanted to grab two people like select two people and then grab them both,just have a dream about a sniper Moira perk as well as other stuff so first of all there be a sniper Moira build with perk that allow she to suck with rmb from really far away and then she have a double ball but it work like select the type first and then click again to shoot first one than another ball of the same type so either two healing or two damage and then would fly fast so you could basically snipe out the widow ah also her shift allow she to basically move to any position on the map even outside of the sky box basically fade turn into godmode and then I just wake up and think that life weaver could grab two people with his e instead of his seed like click twice if want to grab two people like select two people and then grab they both,dream sniper Moira perk stuff sniper Moira build perk allow suck rmb far away double ball work like select type click shoot ball type healing damage fly fast basically snipe widow ah shift allow basically position map outside sky box basically fade turn godmode wake think life weaver grab people e instead seed like click twice want grab people like select people grab

Im so sick of the JunoKiriMercy Skinpocalypse So the new street fighter 6 collaboration was announced today which is very exciting news So many underrated characters cosmetically and popularity wise finally got some more love seriously the Sigma M Bison is genius Seeing the trailer essentially open up with Juno was so annoying already but I was hopeful What really got me was the second we saw the Kiriko kunai At what point is a character getting too many skins in general At some point you gotta get tired of the same 3 characters having 20 legendary skins and mythic skins right Overwatch 2 will not die if Juno Mercy and Kiriko go ONE SEASONCOLLAB without getting a new skin At first it was funny but its just sad at this point I genuinely cannot remember the last time characters like Lucio Soujourn Lifeweaver Symmetra Roadhog and Zarya got any amount of love from collabs or even just skins in general There have been so many collabspecific skins that would have looked better on different characters than the big 3 still not over the fact that Symmetra didnt get a Katara skin for the Avatar collab but I digress or there were so many collabs where other characters from said collab would work better with under appreciated characters I understand these 3 characters are the most popular but come on Replace these 3 characters with any of the aforementioned under appreciated ones and I promise the hype would be through the roof I cant get outta bed for these 3 characters anymore its more than just dont buy their skins lol when they get one Every Single Time PS for the people who cannot go 3 seconds without mentioning profits in chat we will never truly know if a MODERN collab or even just a vanilla season release will be a commercial failure or success if they will never stop giving the same 3 characters legendary skins I really challenge blizzard to got 1 season without a single Mercy Kiriko or Juno skin This will never happen but if them not getting their 8th skins IN A

Do people even like the bans Do we really need it or are we just in need of a crutch LongLong rant Returned to the game from about a 5 month break been spending some time in the game the big new thing to me are the bans What i mean in the title is this do you really have a problem with for ex sombras or you have problems with inadaquate teammates unable to deal with a sombra Or the powerful abilities of a sombra not being checked by devs for months Either of the way i view this system as a crutch The personal prerogative I play ashe i play widow i play ana a lot occasionally if i wanna play tank i play dva or zarya I havent played tank recently so i practically never get my heroes banned unless somebody just really doesnt want a Ana I dont mind sombras tracers when i widow or ana obviously when im not all there and or its to much i must change accordingly but more often then not its a fun cat and mouse game knowing how sombras play when and where they would be coming from etc on widow i would often suprise a sombra just having a spider sense kick in that i got off from years of playing against them knowing how they approach things while playing widow i had the most respectful and fun chats with enemy sombras and tracers This is my own prerogative i understand that its just to say over the years since 2017 Ive been playing weve just had to get used to these heroes that people pick them on my or on the enemies team As a widow player the sombra bans on paper is good for me but it still feels like a cope out given the state of the game it doesnt feel like a given more like its been forced into the cracks of the water tank hoping itll stop the leakage I often stare at my ban options and feel like banning nothing i may be weird but i just like playing against heroes that arent exactly easy to play against Im banning the heroes other people want to ban everytime sombra doom dva zarya mercy sometimes ana sometimes freya but always the same general heroes of 68 The trend remained the same going from plat 1 to masters 2 Everybody just bans the same heroes The only time i see a widow ban is on junkertown or when somebody has unreasonable arachnophobia Its always the same cycle of heroes The few times when sombra wasnt banned the sombras that played got annihilated because everybody focused her Everytime i ask people in the match if they like bans they just say I hate XYZ players so i ban them not even the characters the players League has 170 champions 10 bans match its warranted Overwatch has 43 heroes split across three roles to a lager degree favoring dps heroes like im not gonna cry if you ban widow ive got ashe ive got cree ive got a lot of options of the same caliber generally doing the similar actions from the same branch but you ban ana Thats a entire play style banned off the role there is just no subsidiary to that play style same is true for any of the heroes of the two most affected roles of bans tanksupport If someone only plays a certain subset of heroes wich we all do very very few people play anything more then like 5 heroes on the regular accross all roles a few bans remove all of them Its not even about counterplay anymore its just trimming rosters because matchmaking or meta balance isnt doing its job So again do people even like the bans Or are we just using it as a crutch for problems tucked beneath the bed,Do people even like the bans Do we really need it or are we just in need of a crutch LongLong rant Returned to the game from about a 5 month break been spending some

always the same general heroes of 68 The trend remained the same going from plat 1 to masters 2 Everybody just bans the same heroes The only time i see a widow ban is on junkertown or when somebody has unreasonable arachnophobia Its always the same cycle of heroes The few times when sombra was nt banned the sombras that played got annihilated because everybody focused her Everytime i ask people in the match if they like bans they just say I hate XYZ players so i ban them not even the characters the players League has 170 champions 10 bans match its warranted Overwatch has 43 heroes split across three roles to a lager degree favoring dps heroes like i m not gon na cry if you ban widow i ve got ashe i ve got cree i ve got a lot of options of the same caliber generally doing the similar actions from the same branch but you ban ana That s a entire play style banned off the role there is just no subsidiary to that play style same is true for any of the heroes of the two most affected roles of bans tanksupport If someone only plays a certain subset of heroes wich we all do very very few people play anything more then like 5 heroes on the regular accross all roles a few bans remove all of them Its not even about counterplay anymore its just trimming rosters because matchmaking or meta balance is nt doing its job So again do people even like the bans Or are we just using it as a crutch for problems tucked beneath the bed,do people even like the ban do we really need it or be we just in need of a crutch LongLong rant Returned to the game from about a 5 month break be spend some time in the game the big new thing to I be the ban what I mean in the title be this do you really have a problem with for ex sombra or you have problem with inadaquate teammate unable to deal with a sombra or the powerful ability of a sombra not be check by devs for month either of the way I view this system as a crutch the personal prerogative I play ashe I play widow I play ana a lot occasionally if I wanna play tank I play dva or zarya I have not play tank recently so I practically never get my hero ban unless somebody just really do not want a Ana I do not mind sombra tracer when I widow or ana obviously when I m not all there and or its to much I must change accordingly but more often then not its a fun cat and mouse game know how sombra play when and where they would be come from etc on widow I would often suprise a sombra just have a spider sense kick in that I get off from year of play against they know how they approach thing while play widow I have the most respectful and fun chat with enemy sombra and tracer this be my own prerogative I understand that its just to say over the year since 2017 I ve be play we ve just have to get use to these hero that people pick they on my or on the enemy team as a widow player the sombra ban on paper be good for I but it still feel like a cope out give the state of the game it do not feel like a give more like its be force into the crack of the water tank hope it ll stop the leakage I often stare at my ban option and feel like ban nothing I may be weird but I just like play against hero that be not exactly easy to play against I m ban the hero other people want to ban everytime sombra doom dva zarya mercy sometimes ana sometimes freya but always the same general hero of 68 the trend remain the same go

time when sombra be not ban the sombra that play get annihilate because everybody focus her Everytime I ask people in the match if they like ban they just say I hate xyz player so I ban they not even the character the player League have 170 champion 10 ban match its warranted Overwatch have 43 hero split across three role to a lager degree favor dps hero like I m not go to cry if you ban widow I

First time playing Overwatch since 2020 Some thoughts I had Game is still fun New characters are cool but I CANNOT STAND Kikiro and Junos voices They are so annoying to listen to Hanzo and Widowmaker are still annoying to play against I used to play a lot of Junkrat and Brigitte Junkrat feels very weak compared to the old days maybe its just me Same goes for Brigitte I like the perks I was so disappointed that the story missions are paid content Are they worth buying I also played a lot of Reinhardt and Roadhog and I feel like these heroes have been improved in the fun factor right now I love playing Junker Queen I like the look of Hazard but man he has NOTHING to unlock Even his highlight intros and his emotes ARE THE SAME THING What is going on with all these transformers and anime skins It feels like any original ideas the team had have been replaced by these crossover skins I remember how everyone went crazy for the Halloween costumes good times Some of these skins are extremely hard to read what the actual character is seems like bad design Why are there THREE currencies What are prisms Moiras voice actor is KILLING IT I have yet to see anyone playing Wrecking Ball or Echo I only play casually but the chat is very quiet compared to what I remember Not necessarily a bad thing Every POTG Ive seen has been EXTREMELY underwhelming The animation for each character in character select seems to have changed and gotten worse They often just walk up to the camera and stare at you They used to be ICONIC and now theyre lower quality The new heroes dont seem to have the same issue I miss the end of round report with gold medals Also the different endorsements you could give What the fudge are souvenirs and why should anyone want them Im older than the average player I assume but this battlepass stuff is complete nonsense The free lootboxes I get are absolute trash I really miss the old gameplay loop compared to this stuff and even the old loop of just earning lootboxes was not great Also weapon charms WHAT IS THE POINT OF THESE,First time playing Overwatch since 2020 Some thoughts I had Game is still fun New characters are cool but I CANNOT STAND Kikiro

The Ban System is short sighted and naive Lets assume the goal of a Ban System in any competitive shooter is to encourage creativity by introducing limitations This a normal thing that happens all the time some of the most creative things in the world were done under strict limitations In a game like siege it works because characters arent differentiated drastically If you can play one character you can likely play another just as well and while it will have an impact on how the round plays out in terms of how sites are taken or defended it doesnt have an impact on how well you as a player does In a game like overwatch its a mess For several reasons 1 Characters are so drastically different that a person can actually play a single character and be awful at the rest In overwatch 1 this was a problem that was solved by some people just not ranking up as high and in overwatch 2 this was solved by reducing just how hard some characters countered others most drastically the tanks there are no hard counters in overwatch 2 minus 1 or 2 characters Im going to say this very simply It is okay for someone to want to play one character and nothing else It is okay for rSombraMains to only play sombra It is not your or anyone elses business how someone engages with a product They bought or downloaded the same game and put the same investment into it you did and they are and should be allowed to play it how they see fit If that means they get locked into bronze so be it Play more ranked youll rank up The people hardstuck in gold arent the reason you are hardstuck in gold you are 2 Its so incredibly shortsighted Picking your preferred character has one of two impacts Either they dont ban that character because you want to play it as you can see from rSombraMains thats pretty unlikely as finding 9 random people in however big your matchmaking pool is that is okay with playing against sombra is pretty fucking unlikely or worse they purposefully ban your character This is another avenue for people to grief you and what exactly is a report going to do in this instance This isnt This guy sat around in spawn If they say nothing and just ban your character you are shit out of luck They are not going to get punished And i know this happens because I just got out of a game where someone told me they were going to ban my character And for every person that tells you they are doing something there are more that dont 3 It doesnt encourage creativity It has already shown that people will instead just ban what they dont like and move on It has nothing to do with creativity It has nothing to do with finding creative ways to solve problems and everything to do with arbitrarily letting people remove characters they dont like play against We had a system that encouraged creativity and it was ban pools A rotating pool of bans forces some people to sometimes play new characters and it also forces the meta to constantly rotate and evolve You can build strong strategies in a short period of time while not completely removing a character from existence because 90 of the community doesnt like playing against them 4 It will always take an entire character out of play for most of the community It saves a minority of the playerbase a headache of dealing with a character at the time Right now sombra and costs the entire playerbase that wants to play that character the option to do so indefinitely Or does anyone believe that there was ever a version of sombra that wouldnt get banned Im not a sombra main by the way Just an irritated guy who really enjoys overwatch but is starting to not be able to stand competitive for this system alone I also love overwatch i think the majority of the changes since overwatch 2 have been good for the game But

Just spitball any and all ideas you have Sombra reworks Just say ideas maybe something can be made that isnt hated too much Nothing serious I just want to see what takes people have My take I want to make her a support BUT shed still be a damage support like Zenyatta Her perks would let her lean more into damaging or supporting duh I wanted her to be a twosided coin where she will hurt or heal whoever she has to to get what she wants I wanted to rework stealth into a meter like DVas defence matrix Stealth just feels clunky now I want Sombra to be able to switch in and out but it shouldnt be permanent The meter drains whilst invisible and lasts up to 5 seconds with faster move speed and it takes 10 seconds to fully recharge Sombra can switch in and out freely with a 1 second cooldown like defence matrix or take a breather Translocator no longer grants invis of course and instead works more like the old one Sombra can throw a Translocator and has maybe 5 seconds to teleport to it before it destroys itself This gives Sombra more flexibility but she also cant just hide invisibly forever and teleport back to spawn as soon as someone sneezes in her general direction She has to stay in the fight but gets a sort of minirecall and she can maintain her vertical mobility if she needs to Sombra can also hack teammates by default giving a little temporary health and some lifesteal She also gains ultimate charge if they use her hacked health packs but because they regenerate faster she gets less ultimate charge from them Her hack on enemies however is now more like a hinder Low mobility characters are less affected than high ones of course Reinhardt loses charge but not shield or firestrikes Ashe keeps dynamite but her coach gun doesnt knock herself back anymore Sombra would be too supporting as a DPS so as a support shes more of an enabler than a healer Youd need another support with great AoE healing like Baptiste or Moira to compensate just raw high numbers or you could run Sombra and Zenyatta and just have a full suicide charge team which would be like instalocking 4 DPS If you can kill the enemy before they can kill you healing isnt required probably I also now realise she has too many abilities for her buttons Gun for left click hack for right invis on shift teleport on E virus onvirus as a part of hack would suuuuuuck Could make it a skillshot ultimate like pulse bomb but itd be really underwhelming even if it charged basically instantly Teleport on crouch like youre laying a translocator egg Then how would you throw it upwards Perks One major perk I stole from Questron I think is a new Viral Replication if an enemy affected by Virus is killed all other enemies in an 8M radius are also affected by Virus Another major perk I thought of was called Firewall Sombra can Hack her own teammates to give them temporary immunity to debuffs like bleed burn antiheal discord etc I debated between debuffs and CC like a mini fortify but I really didnt want Sombra to give already mobile characters CC immunity since I want her to do the opposite of enable these kinds of heroes Both CC and debuff immunity was never an option or else she could give Doomfist steroids 50 of the time Cut ideas One cut idea I had was called Trojan Horse where any targets hacked by Sombra would spread the Hack to anyone they heal This idea sounded fantastic on someone like Mercy or Ana but I realised it would be the most overpowered thing imaginable on someone like Lucio Baptiste or Brigitte Lucio could at least switch to speed and Bap needs to avoid regenerative burst like its the plague but Brigittejust needs to leave I guess she cant fight or else shell heal An even worse idea was to invert all healing temporarily so enemies will damage their allies instead This idea was purged even quicker than the last one because its just worse somehow I also quickly brainstormed some other things like EMP leaving behind a lingering hack AoE but I decided against it as it could just be used on point and invalidate a large chunk of the roster Another short lived idea was a teamwide invisibility Take a guess why that didnt last Aside from how OP it would be your teammates wouldnt be allowed to attack if they wanted to keep their invisibility and how would that even work in some characters anyway Again never a serious ideas I was just cycling through whatever

Thanks Clarifications To My Support Sombra Rework Hey everyone Thank you to all who engaged with my Sombra support rework proposal Whether you agreed or not I appreciate the constructive feedback and discussions Addressing Damage Concerns A common concern is that this rework significantly reduces Sombras damage In reality her bodyshot damage sees an approximate 18 reduction balanced by new healing and utility capabilities She retains high output potential through headshots and strategic use of her Virus ability For comparison heroes like Zenyatta Kiriko and Baptiste can achieve similar or higher damage when played skillfully This rework emphasizes precision and timing over raw burst Moreover the reduced damage lessens the frustration of sudden eliminations from stealth If a Sombra chooses to engage from invisibility the extended engagement window allows teammates more opportunity to react and assist introducing risk to aggressive plays and encouraging more thoughtful decisionmaking Clarifying DualUse Abilities Both Hack and Virus can target allies and enemies but their functions are distinct and intuitive A straightforward input determines the target type and abilities behave differently based on the targeteither aiding a teammate or debuffing an opponent Cooldowns adjust accordingly rewarding smart and flexible play without overwhelming complexity Regarding Virus its dualuse design isnt bloated It requires precise positioning to avoid being blocked by teammates and if it does get blocked the cooldown reduction on ally hits mitigates the penalty maintaining a fair balance between challenge and usability Rationale for the Change This rework leans into Sombras original identitydisruption and team impact over burst eliminations from stealth In Overwatch 2 her constant ability shutdowns sudden ambushes and frequent escapes have made her feel frustrating even when not overpowered Shifting her into a support role preserves her agility and cleverness but channels them into more deliberate teamfocused plays And to those saying lorewise she shouldnt be healingreally Its 2025 Sombras been healing since day one with hacked health packs Brigitte heals allies by inspiring them with vibes Lets not pretend lore is some sacred gameplay barrier now Besides Sombras entire role in Infiltration and A Great Day is supportadjacentshe gathers intel sets up plays and operates from the shadows Shes never been the main gun That doesnt mean she cant shootit means she knows when to This rework just brings that narrative into her kit where its always quietly lived Considering Current Players Some worry this shift might alienate existing Sombra players but role changes arent newDoomfists rework is proof that change can benefit overall game health even if not everyone embraces it This rework isnt meant to satisfy every Sombra main Its geared toward OG players and those who already lean into her utility and supportive playstylenot just through perks like White Hat but in mindset If youre someone who enjoys highlethality flanks every six seconds this rework probably isnt for youand thats okay Support Sombra doesnt erase her identity It refocuses it in a way that lowers frustration promotes decisionmaking and still rewards smart highimpact play Thats worth considering not dismissing Why Support Im not asserting that Sombra must become a support These ideas stem from exploring viable solutions and my documentation elaborates on why a support shift is plausible Its not the sole path but a potential avenue for Blizzard to consider especially given multiple reworks as a DPS havent resolved existing issues If you have concepts for a DPS rework please share them in the comments Lets discuss their viability concerning both Sombra players and the broader communitys experience facing her The objective is to develop a healthier version of Sombra Currently despite being undertuned her playstyle can leave a negative impression Many Sombra mains myself included believe that reducing her lethality and utility uptimenot utility valueis a constructive direction This rework focuses on these principles Its not the only solution but a feasible one I encourage you to assess the kits viability rather than focusing solely on role preference Not all supports are traditional healers this Sombra can still achieve game highlights and substantial kill and damage stats akin to heroes like Zenyatta or Kiriko The comprehensive rework details including healing mechanics damage comparisons and responses to common concerns are available in this Google Doc or on my profile Future updates will be even conciser summaries than this Thank you again for your engagement and contributions to refining this concept Lets continue striving for thoughtful hero design improvements,Thanks Clarifications To My Support Sombra Rework Hey everyone Thank you to all who engaged with my Sombra support rework proposal Whether you agreed or not I appreciate the constructive feedback and discussions Addressing Damage Concerns A common concern is that this rework significantly reduces Sombras damage In reality her bodyshot damage sees an approximate 18 reduction balanced by new healing and utility capabilities She retains high output potential through headshots and strategic use of her Virus ability For comparison heroes like Zenyatta Kiriko and Baptiste can achieve similar or higher damage when played skillfully This rework emphasizes precision and timing over raw burst Moreover the reduced damage lessens the frustration of sudden eliminations from stealth If a Sombra chooses to engage from invisibility the extended engagement window allows teammates more opportunity to react and assist introducing risk to aggressive plays and encouraging more thoughtful decisionmaking Clarifying DualUse Abilities Both Hack and Virus can target allies and enemies but their functions are distinct and intuitive A straightforward input determines the target type and abilities behave differently based on the targeteither aiding a teammate or debuffing an opponent Cooldowns adjust accordingly rewarding smart and flexible play without overwhelming complexity Regarding Virus its dualuse design is nt bloated It requires precise positioning to avoid being blocked by teammates and if it does get blocked the cooldown reduction on ally hits mitigates the penalty maintaining a fair balance between challenge and usability Rationale for the Change This rework leans into Sombras original identitydisruption and team impact over burst eliminations from stealth In Overwatch 2 her constant ability shutdowns sudden ambushes and frequent escapes have made her feel frustrating even when not overpowered Shifting her into a support role preserves her agility and cleverness but channels them into more deliberate teamfocused plays And to those saying lorewise she should nt be healingreally Its 2025 Sombras been healing since day one with hacked health packs Brigitte heals allies by inspiring them with vibes Lets not pretend lore is some sacred gameplay barrier now Besides Sombras entire role in Infiltration and A Great Day is supportadjacentshe gathers intel sets up plays and operates from the shadows She s never been the main gun That does nt mean she ca nt shootit means she knows when to This rework just brings that narrative into her kit where its always quietly lived Considering Current Players Some worry this shift might alienate existing Sombra players but role changes are nt newDoomfists rework is proof that change can benefit overall game health even if not everyone embraces it This rework is nt meant to satisfy every Sombra main Its geared toward OG players and those who already lean into her utility

Can we have a civil discussion Hey everyone Ive been a long time OW player playing the game since its initial release back in 2016 It was the first FPS team shooter Ive ever played and I thought it was a cool new and exciting change Met a lot of people and made a lot of friends because of it Years of playing and getting better with time there was an announcement that overwatch 2 was going to happen I was excited about it because I felt OW was a pretty solid game I was wrong They things that they promised like having a story mode you can play with your friends never happened as far as I am concerned On top of that the Ow I have grown to love was gone A game I paid money for was erased and I was forced into a game that I didnt even get to try out beforehand I was robbed in a financial since never again able to play a game that I paid for Then theres just being robbed of fun I played the game it wasnt too bad the initial drop date My friends and I grumbled about it but we trucked along Changes to heros I could live with like Orisa and her Javalin with the loss of a shield barrier Even Doom becoming DPS But more changes came and I was getting more irritated The biggest change was the player base All of the OG players started dropping off because they hated the changes and I couldnt blame them In came a new player base Many of them I met were one trick ponies and played the game like it was COD The game felt like it was ushering in a new team dynamic which was actually not being a team Supporting a play style that encouraged many players to be solo in a five no longer 6 until recent updates player team Now there are bans because its too hard and annoying to combat characters like symetra and Sombra Isnt the whole point of comp and team based games is to work together to beat other players and the opposing team I feel like this game is dead and no longer fun Maybe a lot of youd dont feel the way I feel but I would love to hear your opinions regardless As the title

My Issues with Ow2 Stadium This Script is being written on 592025 This will eventually Be outdated So I have been playing a LOT of overwatch stadium Its fun for the most part The Most Part Alright Ill cut the short act Overwatch stadium is far from perfect like eons from perfect this is Every single issue I have with stadium 1 Mercy Jesus Christ this creature in this game is the most unfair character as unfair characters get I would rather fight soldier before tactical visor buffs if it meant that mercy either got removed from the roster or just nerfed heavily One of her upgrades makes her staff able to heal from an extra 33 farther distance Do you understand what all of this means If you have a slight understanding of good mercy mobility YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY UNKILLABLE Before all you redditors go in the comments and go eguh bro never played before I have at least 100 hours in this game The worst part is that the roster is so small noone can perfectly counter mercy Widowmaker would be great for this but guess what shes not in the roster 2 Weapon Power Boosts Attack Speed Boosts Annoying but fine Cooldown Reducers Rare But my lord do Power and attack boosts need either a higher price increase or a Cap Only way to exceed the cap is to use the special ability modifiers Otherwise you cant exceed the cap Sure some characters could use damage boosts but maybe Cassidy Reinhardt and Soldier 76 can have a slight nerf in dmg boosts I was playing genji and there was a cassidy who just got one headshot and one shot me he had 40 dmg boost A FORTY PERCENT DAMAGE BOOST 3 Anyone who plays Orisa Dva Kiriko Mercy Moria Cassidy and mei Exclusively for their stupid amounts of op powerups Go touch Grass 4 Ana This is a generally personal issue with Ana in general but I will continue I am under the personal idea that you shouldnt have an ability that makes one aspect of the game unable to work for 12 seconds Anas nade is already annoying What makes it worse is when she sleeps you first I believe that she should have a heal reducing nade not a heal canceling nade You have the code for it to work Just fix it 5 Moria I think by this consensus If a character has a high healing output give them either low health with few ways to make it back or give them low dps Moria ignores BOTH of these That paired with the noskill auto aim being a part of her main weapon and her biotic orbs make these annoying already That paired with the fact that she gets a get out of jail free card with no way of figuring out where she went besides an audio cue which lets face it you wont hear while a whole war is being fought6 Genji Genji is very very bad in stadium Even though I still play him I will admit he is terrible His dragonblade is almost never able to be used even then it can barely 2 hit Supports and his abilities suck to use when your just starting out Sure I can Play a different game or hero But why dont you guys get off of fortnight and reddit when you lose a game and then go on a rant about how the weapon is completely broken I know that is Ironic coming from this video but I feel like I am making a pretty good point 7 Upgrades Sure stadium is fun but I want more experimentation sure the whole thing is more arcade like game But the whole power system is a little eh Im not trying to dunk on the programmers because I know that it takes time to write game code I want more powers that change your abilities make genjis dash make him turn around and slash again but make it deal 50 less damage Make morias fade able to blind someone for a quick second make mercy unplayable Make dva pilotable while self destruct is online for a little bit longer at the cost of her life 6 Genji Genji is very very bad in stadium Even though I still play him I will admit he

is overwatch 2 is not perfect and frankly it will never be Blizzard will constantly try to fix the issue but make 50 more I believe that CircletoonsHD said it best Blizzard created a game so bad that
